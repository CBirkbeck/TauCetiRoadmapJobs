# Period and index on real surfaces: target signatures

The roadmap is `README.md`; this file is not the roadmap. It states the roadmap's headline
theorems against the pinned Mathlib and Tau Ceti, each with `sorry`, together with the one
definition they need (`HasZeroTotalSignature`).

Conventions. The function field of an integral surface over `ℝ` is a field `K` with
`Algebra.EssFiniteType ℝ K` and `Algebra.trdeg ℝ K = 2`; `K` is nonreal when `¬ IsSemireal K`
(for a smooth projective model `S` of `K` this is `S(ℝ) = ∅`). The period of a central simple
`K`-algebra `A` is `orderOf (TauCeti.BrauerGroup.mk A)` in Tau Ceti's group structure on Mathlib's
`BrauerGroup`, and its index is `TauCeti.Algebra.index K A`; quantifying over all `A` quantifies
over all Brauer classes.

Headline theorems stated here (B19 = Benoist, *The period-index problem for real surfaces*,
Publ. Math. IHÉS 130 (2019)):

* de Jong's theorem in characteristic zero (README §2.9), `index_eq_orderOf_of_isAlgClosed`;
* the norm bound over real closed fields (§2.10), `index_dvd_two_mul_orderOf_of_isRealClosed`;
* Theorem 0.3 (§7.4), `index_eq_orderOf_of_not_isSemireal`;
* Theorem 0.4 in its birational form (§7.5), `index_eq_orderOf_of_forall_isRealClosed`;
* Theorem 0.12 (§§7.8, 7.10), `not_anisotropic_of_hasZeroTotalSignature` and
  `exists_anisotropic_hasZeroTotalSignature`;
* Theorem 0.10 (§7.11), `not_anisotropic_of_not_isSemireal`;
* the pair-of-quadrics theorem behind Theorem 0.13 (§7.13), `exists_common_zero_of_not_isSemireal`.

Headline theorems not statable at the pins:

* Theorem 0.4 in its scheme form (classes of `Br(U)` on a smooth real surface `U` vanishing at
  every real point): Mathlib and Tau Ceti have no Brauer group of a scheme and no evaluation of a
  Brauer class at a real point. Its birational form above is equivalent (README §7.5).
* Theorem 0.5 (the topological criterion `ind = per` or `ind = 2 per` for `α ∈ Br(S)`): it needs
  `Br(S)`, the Borel equivariant cohomology `H²_G(S(ℂ), 𝔽₂)`, the real Kummer sequence and the
  canonical real-locus components `[ξ]₁ ∈ H¹(S(ℝ), 𝔽₂)`, none of which is at the pins.
* Theorem 0.6 (real Enriques surfaces with `ind ≠ per`): it needs real Enriques surfaces, the
  halves of their real locus, `w₁` of the real locus and `Br(S)`; none is at the pins.
* Proposition 0.7 (a K3 surface over the real Puiseux field with `H¹(S(K), 𝔽₂) = 0` and a class of
  `Br(S)[2]` of index 4): it needs K3 surfaces, semialgebraic cohomology over a non-archimedean
  real closed field and `Br(S)`.
* Theorem 0.13 in its stated form (degree-four del Pezzo surfaces over `ℝ(C)` have rational
  points): del Pezzo surfaces are not at the pins. The pair-of-quadrics theorem stated below
  implies it through the anticanonical model of README §7.12.

/-! ## Layer 0: real function fields -/

/-- A quadratic form `q` over a field `K` (with `2` invertible) has **zero total signature**: for
every real closed field `R` with a `K`-algebra structure, the base change `q_R` vanishes on an
`R`-subspace of `R ⊗[K] V` of half the dimension of `V`. For nondegenerate `q` this says that the
signature of `q` vanishes at every ordering of `K` (Sylvester's law over the real closure); for
nonreal `K` it holds for every form. This is the condition in the Elman–Lam u-invariant
(README §0.6; B19 §0.5, p. 66; EKM §37). -/

characteristic zero and `K` a finitely generated field extension of `k` of transcendence degree
`2`, every central simple `K`-algebra has index equal to the period of its Brauer class

`K`-algebra divides twice the period of its class (README §2.10; B19 §0.1, p. 63). -/

a finitely generated field extension of `ℝ` of transcendence degree `2` in which `-1` is a sum of
squares, then every central simple `K`-algebra has index equal to the period of its class

transcendence degree `2` and `A` a central simple `K`-algebra whose class becomes trivial over
every real closed field `R` with a `K`-algebra structure. Then the index of `A` equals the period

necessarily finitely generated, the Elman–Lam invariant is at most `4`: every quadratic form over
`K` of dimension greater than `4` with zero total signature is isotropic (README §7.8; B19

generated of transcendence degree `2` over `ℝ`, with `-1` a sum of squares), every quadratic form
of dimension at least `5` is isotropic (README §7.11; B19 Theorem 0.10, p. 66). -/

/-- **Pairs of quadrics over real curves without real points (Theorem 0.13).** Over the function
field `K` of a real curve without real points (finitely generated of transcendence degree `1` over
`ℝ`, with `-1` a sum of squares), any two quadratic forms on a space of dimension at least `5`
have a common nonzero zero; in particular every degree-four del Pezzo surface over `K` has a
