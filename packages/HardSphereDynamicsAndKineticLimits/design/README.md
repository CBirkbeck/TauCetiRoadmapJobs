# Roadmap: hard-sphere dynamics and kinetic limits

**Summary.** Build the microscopic model of classical kinetic theory: finitely many hard spheres of diameter ε in a flat position space (Euclidean space ℝᵈ or a flat torus ℝᵈ/L), their elastic scattering law, their trajectories, and the almost-everywhere defined hard-sphere flow. The core theorem is Alexander's theorem for finitely many particles: outside a Lebesgue-null set every configuration has a global trajectory with only binary, non-grazing collisions, finitely many in bounded time, and the resulting maps form a measure-preserving group. On this flow the roadmap builds the transport of densities and the weak Liouville equation with specular reflection, marginals and correlation functions, the canonical and grand canonical equilibrium ensembles with their invariance, and the hard-sphere Boltzmann collision operator. It states Lanford's theorem on the Boltzmann–Grad limit as a proposition for the roadmaps that prove it, and proves here its law-of-large-numbers consequence: convergence of the first two correlation functions forces the rescaled empirical measure to concentrate on the Boltzmann solution. Everything rests on Mathlib's Lebesgue change of variables, lattice quotients and Gaussian integrals, and on Tau Ceti's Gaussian densities, strongly continuous groups and empirical measures.

## Scope and ownership

This roadmap owns: flat position spaces as quotients of Euclidean space carrying a local isometry and a local measure isomorphism; the flat torus ℝᵈ/L with its Euclidean quotient norm and Haar measure; the specular scattering map and the pre/post-collisional change of variables; the hard-core phase spaces, contacts, contact normals and boundary pieces; the two-body problem (relative motion outside a ball) with its collision map and Jacobian; hard-sphere trajectories, their uniqueness and symmetries; Alexander's theorem for finitely many particles; the hard-sphere flow, its Koopman group and the grand canonical phase space; transported densities, the weak Liouville equation with specular reflection and marginals; Maxwellians, canonical and grand canonical measures, their invariance, correlation functions and initial chaos; the rescaled empirical measure, the hard-sphere Boltzmann collision operator, mild solutions of the Boltzmann equation, the statement of Lanford's theorem and its law of large numbers.

Already in the library and consumed, not restated: Lebesgue change of variables for injective differentiable maps, Haar measure on quotients by a lattice and fundamental domains, quotient norms, polar coordinates and the surface measure `MeasureTheory.Measure.toSphere`, Gaussian integrals, `ProbabilityTheory.poissonMeasure`, composition operators on `Lp` (Mathlib); the multivariate Gaussian density, strongly continuous one-parameter groups and the empirical measure of a finite population (Tau Ceti). The multivariate Gaussian density is the material of StandardDistributions, Layer 5, and the strongly continuous group is the material of OneParameterSemigroups; both are cited here through their pinned Tau Ceti declarations.

Left to other roadmaps. The proof of Lanford's theorem (the BBGKY and Boltzmann hierarchies, their Cauchy problems and term-by-term convergence) belongs to a roadmap on the BBGKY hierarchy, which proves the proposition stated in §10.4. The Cauchy problem for the Boltzmann equation, the H theorem and the converse characterisation of collision invariants belong to a roadmap on the Boltzmann equation, which consumes §10.2–10.3. Fluctuations and large deviations of the empirical measure, long-time derivations, infinite hard-sphere systems, short-range potentials, uniform bounds on the number of collisions, and ergodicity of hard-sphere systems are subjects of later roadmaps listed under Downstream consumers. Finite point processes with a density against a Poisson process, Janossy measures and Papangelou intensities on unlabelled point measures are the subject of the PointProcesses roadmap; the grand canonical measure here lives on labelled configurations, where the flow acts, and its image in point measures is not restated. Complex tori as complex Lie groups are owned by ComplexTori; the real flat torus here carries a metric and a measure, not a complex structure. Smooth Hamiltonian flows and Liouville's theorem for smooth vector fields are not used: free transport is a shear, and the measure preservation of the hard-sphere flow is proved directly from the two-body Jacobian.

Uniqueness of weak solutions of the Liouville equation with specular reflection is not part of this roadmap: the transported density is characterised by its Lagrangian identity (§8.1), which is what every consumer uses.

## Conventions

- **Dimension and spaces.** `d ≥ 1` throughout; the proposition of §10.4 assumes `d ≥ 2`, as its sources do. `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)` with its inner product `⟨·,·⟩`, norm `|·|` and Lebesgue measure `vol`. A position space is a type `X` with an instance of the class of §1.1; its cover is `π : E → X`, its injectivity radius `ρ ∈ (0, ∞]`, and its measure `μ_X = volume`. The one-particle phase space is `X × E` with measure `μ_X ⊗ vol`; the `N`-particle phase space is `Fin N → X × E` with the product measure `λ_N = volume`. Write a configuration as `Z = (X, V)` with positions `x_i` and velocities `v_i`.
- **Diameter.** ε is the diameter: particles `i ≠ j` are in contact when `‖x_i − x_j‖ = ε`. Every dynamical statement assumes `0 < ε < ρ`. Witness: on `E` with ε = 1, positions `0` and `(1, 0)` are in contact.
- **Hard-core sets.** `𝒟̄^ε_N = {Z : ‖x_i − x_j‖ ≥ ε for all i ≠ j}` (closed) and `𝒟^ε_N` with strict inequalities (open). The flow lives on `𝒟̄^ε_N`.
- **Contact normal.** For a contact pair, `ν_ij = ℓ(x_i − x_j)/ε`, where `ℓ` is the short lift of §1.1; it points from particle `j` to particle `i`, and `ν_ji = −ν_ij`. Witness: `x_i = (1, 0)`, `x_j = 0`, ε = 1 gives `ν_ij = (1, 0)`.
- **Scattering.** `σ_ν(v, w) = (v − ⟨v − w, ν⟩ν, w + ⟨v − w, ν⟩ν)` for a unit vector ν. A contact pair is incoming when `⟨v_i − v_j, ν_ij⟩ < 0`, outgoing when `> 0`, grazing when `= 0`. Witness: at `x_i = (1, 0)`, `x_j = 0`, the velocities `v_i = (−1, 0)`, `v_j = 0` are incoming and are sent to `v_i' = 0`, `v_j' = (−1, 0)`.
- **Right-continuous velocities.** A trajectory's velocity is right-continuous: the state at a collision time carries the outgoing velocities. The left-continuous convention of DengHaniMa2024 is obtained by applying the contact scattering (§5.4). Witness: two particles on `E`, d = 2, ε = 1, starting at `x_1 = (2, 0)`, `x_2 = 0` with `v_1 = (−1, 0)`, `v_2 = 0`, collide at time 1; the state at time 1 has `v_1 = 0`, `v_2 = (−1, 0)`, and at time 3 the positions are `(1, 0)` and `(−2, 0)`.
- **Time reversal.** `ℛ(X, V) = (X, −σ_M V)`, where `σ_M` applies the scattering to every pair of the contact matching `M` of `X` (§3.3). It agrees with `(X, V) ↦ (X, −V)` off the contact set.
- **Junk values.** The flow `T_t` is the trajectory map on the good set `G` and the identity off `G`; it is therefore defined everywhere and is an exact group action.
- **Transport sign.** A density is transported as `W(t) = W⁰ ∘ T_{−t}`. Witness: for one particle on `E`, `W(t)(x, v) = W⁰(x − t v, v)`, so `W(1)((1, 0), (1, 0)) = W⁰(0, (1, 0))`.
- **Maxwellians.** `M_{β,u}(v) = (β/2π)^{d/2} exp(−β|v − u|²/2)` with inverse temperature `β > 0` and mean velocity `u`. Witness: d = 1, β = 1, u = 0 gives `M(0) = 1/√(2π) ≈ 0.39894`.
- **Sphere measure.** σ_S is the sphere measure `MeasureTheory.Measure.toSphere` of Lebesgue measure on the unit sphere `S^{d−1}`, of total mass `d·ω_d` with `ω_d = vol(B(0,1))`. Witness: d = 3 gives total mass 4π; d = 2 gives 2π.
- **Grand canonical normalisation.** The weight of `N` particles is `μ^N/N!` with normalising constant `Z`; correlation functions are rescaled by `μ^{−n}` as in BGSS2023 (1.1.10). In the Boltzmann–Grad scaling `μ_ε = ε^{−(d−1)}`. Witness: d = 3, ε = 0.1 gives `μ_ε = 100`.
- **Extended reals.** Densities of measures, partition functions and correlation functions are `ℝ≥0∞`-valued (lower integrals), so that no integrability side condition is hidden; real-valued statements take `toReal` under explicit finiteness hypotheses.

- `MeasureTheory.Measure.map_linearMap_addHaar_eq_smul_addHaar` (`Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Measure/Lebesgue/EqHaar.lean`): a linear map of nonzero determinant pushes an additive Haar measure forward to `|det|^{−1}` times itself, so a linear map of determinant `±1` preserves it.

## How to read the build

Layer 1 fixes the position space: an abstract flat position space, its two instances (Euclidean space and the flat torus), and the local geometry of shells and packings. Layer 2 is the algebra of one elastic collision. Layer 3 sets up phase space, contacts, contact scattering, time reversal and free transport. Layer 4 solves the two-body problem and proves that its flow preserves Lebesgue measure through the Jacobian of the collision map; this is the analytic core. Layer 5 defines trajectories and proves uniqueness and the symmetries. Layer 6 proves Alexander's theorem from the near-triple estimate and an iteration in short time steps. Layer 7 packages the flow, its measure preservation, its Koopman group and the grand canonical phase space. Layer 8 transports densities and derives the weak Liouville equation and the marginals. Layer 9 builds the equilibrium and grand canonical ensembles and their correlation functions. Layer 10 defines the empirical measure, the Boltzmann collision operator and mild solutions, states Lanford's theorem as a proposition and proves its law of large numbers.

The Lean names that appear in backticks below and are not Mathlib or Tau Ceti declarations are the declarations of `Suggested.lean`: the class `FlatPositionSpace`, the definitions `FlatTorus`, `HardSphere.scatter`, `HardSphere.hardCoreSet`, `HardSphere.IsTrajectory`, `HardSphere.goodSet`, `HardSphere.flow`, `HardSphere.grandCanonical`, `HardSphere.correlation`, `HardSphere.empirical`, `HardSphere.collisionOperator`, `HardSphere.IsMildBoltzmannSolution` and `HardSphere.LanfordStatement`, and the theorems named in §5.2, §6.4, §7.1, §7.2, §7.3, §8.2, §9.4, §9.5, §9.6 and §10.5.

## Layer 1: Flat position spaces

### 1.1 Flat position spaces

Define the class `FlatPositionSpace d X` for a normed additive commutative group `X` that is a proper metric space with Borel measurable structure and a measure `volume`. Its data are an additive homomorphism `π : E →+ X` (the cover) and a radius `ρ ∈ (0, ∞]` (the injectivity radius); its axioms are: `π` is surjective; `‖π a‖ ≤ |a|` for every `a`; every `ξ ∈ X` with `‖ξ‖ < ρ` has a lift `a` with `π a = ξ` and `|a| = ‖ξ‖`; `π` is injective on the open ball `B(0, ρ)`; `volume` is invariant under translations; and `volume(π(A)) = vol(A)` for every measurable `A ⊆ B(0, ρ)`. This is the common carrier of the two settings of the sources: ℝᵈ (GST2013 line 833) and the torus (BGSS2023 line 119). Instances fix ρ as the largest radius for which the axioms hold.

API:

- The short lift: for `‖ξ‖ < ρ` there is a unique `ℓ(ξ) ∈ B(0, ρ)` with `π(ℓ(ξ)) = ξ`; it satisfies `|ℓ(ξ)| = ‖ξ‖`, `ℓ(−ξ) = −ℓ(ξ)`, `ℓ(π a) = a` for `|a| < ρ`, and `ℓ` is continuous on the ball of radius ρ.
- Local isometry: `π` is 1-Lipschitz, and `‖π a − π b‖ = |a − b|` whenever `|a − b| < ρ`; for `r ≤ ρ` the image `π(B(a, r))` is the ball `B(π a, r)`.
- Balls and spheres: for `r ≤ ρ`, `volume(B(x, r)) = vol(B(0, r))`; for `0 < r < ρ` the sphere `{y : ‖y − x‖ = r}` is null.
- Measure: `volume` is an additive Haar measure, σ-finite, finite on bounded sets, and regular.
- Free transport by velocity: `x ↦ x + π(t v)` is a measure-preserving homeomorphism of `X` for every `t ∈ ℝ` and `v ∈ E`, and `(t, x) ↦ x + π(t v)` is continuous.

**Checks.**

- On `E` itself with `π = id` and ρ = ∞ every axiom holds, and the short lift is the identity.
- On the unit flat torus of §1.3 in dimension 2, the class of `(1/2, 1/2)` has norm `√2/2 ≈ 0.7071`, and ρ = 1/2; the short lift of the class of `(0.9, 0)` is `(−0.1, 0)`.
- Mathlib's `UnitAddTorus (Fin 2)` with its supremum norm is not an instance for the coordinate cover: the class of `(0.1, 0.1)` has supremum norm 0.1 while every lift has Euclidean norm at least `0.1414`, so the lift axiom fails.
- The degenerate radius is excluded: with ρ = 0 the lift axiom would be vacuous and every contact normal undefined; the class requires `0 < ρ`.

(GST2013 line 833; BGSS2023 line 119.) *Needs:* Mathlib `EuclideanSpace`, `MeasureTheory.Measure.IsAddHaarMeasure`, `MeasureTheory.Measure.addHaar_sphere`, `EuclideanSpace.volume_ball`.

### 1.2 Euclidean space as a position space

Give `E` the instance with `π = id` and ρ = ∞. Prove that every statement of this roadmap specialises on `E` to the formula with `ℓ = id`, so that `ν_ij = (x_i − x_j)/ε`.

**Checks.**

- The contact normal of `x_i = (1, 0)`, `x_j = 0` at ε = 1 is `(1, 0)`.
- The ball volume in d = 3 at radius 1 is `4π/3 ≈ 4.18879`, from `EuclideanSpace.volume_ball`.
- Free transport of `x = 0` with `v = (1, 0)` for time 2 gives `(2, 0)`.

(GST2013 lines 833–841.) *Needs:* §1.1, Mathlib `EuclideanSpace.volume_ball`.

### 1.3 Flat tori

For `L : Submodule ℤ E` with `[DiscreteTopology L]` and `[IsZLattice ℝ L]`, define `FlatTorus L` as the quotient group `E ⧸ L.toAddSubgroup` of `E` by the additive subgroup underlying `L` (the submodule quotient `E ⧸ L` has the same carrier by definition, `Submodule.quotientRel` being `QuotientAddGroup.leftRel L.toAddSubgroup`, and the `QuotientAddGroup` declarations below are stated for the subgroup form), with the quotient norm `QuotientAddGroup.instNormedAddCommGroup` (`L` is closed because it is discrete, `AddSubgroup.isClosed_of_discreteTopology`), the Borel σ-algebra of the quotient topology (`QuotientAddGroup.borelSpace`), and the `MeasureSpace` instance whose `volume` is the image under the quotient map of Lebesgue measure restricted to the fundamental domain `ZSpan.fundamentalDomain` of a chosen `ℤ`-basis of `L` (`ZLattice.isAddFundamentalDomain`). Prove that this set is also a fundamental domain for the opposite subgroup `AddSubgroup.op L.toAddSubgroup` acting by right translation, the action in Mathlib's quotient-measure theorems (`E` is commutative, so the two actions are the same maps). The rest is Mathlib's and is cited, not proved here: `volume` satisfies `MeasureTheory.AddQuotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage vol volume` (`MeasureTheory.IsFundamentalDomain.quotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage_quotientMeasure`, additive form), so it is the image of `vol` restricted to every fundamental domain of `L`, whichever basis was chosen (`MeasureTheory.IsAddFundamentalDomain.addProjection_respects_measure`); the quotient map is measure preserving from `vol` restricted to any fundamental domain (`measurePreserving_quotientAddGroup_mk_of_AddQuotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage`); and `volume` is a finite additive Haar measure (`MeasureTheory.QuotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage.haarMeasure_quotient`, additive form, whose hypotheses hold: `E` is Polish and locally compact, the quotient is a metric space and second countable, `L` is countable and normal, `vol` is Haar and right invariant, and the total mass is the measure of a bounded fundamental domain). Prove that this total mass is `ZLattice.covolume L` (`ZLattice.covolume_eq_measure_fundamentalDomain`). Give `FlatTorus L` the instance of §1.1 with `π` the quotient map and ρ equal to half the minimal norm of a nonzero lattice vector: the lift axiom and injectivity on `B(0, ρ)` follow from `QuotientAddGroup.norm_mk` (`‖π a‖` is the distance from `a` to `L`, attained since `L` is discrete), translation invariance of `volume` is the Haar property, and the local measure axiom follows from unfolding a fundamental domain `𝓕`: for measurable `A ⊆ B(0, ρ)` the translates `A + k`, `k ∈ L`, are disjoint, so `volume(π(A)) = vol(π⁻¹(π(A)) ∩ 𝓕) = Σ_k vol(A ∩ (𝓕 − k)) = vol(A)`. Write `𝕋^d` for the unit flat torus, `L = ℤᵈ` spanned by the standard basis.

API:

- The chosen fundamental domain is a fundamental domain for the opposite subgroup, and `volume` is the image of `vol` restricted to every fundamental domain of `L`. Non-example: for `ℤ^d` with `d ≥ 2` the ball `B(0, 1/2)` is not a fundamental domain, although `π` is injective on it: its translates cover only a set of density `ω_d/2^d < 1` (`π/4` in `d = 2`), so the image of `vol` restricted to it has total mass `ω_d/2^d`, not 1; the cube `[0, 1)^d` is one (and in `d = 1` the interval `(−1/2, 1/2)` is one up to the null set `1/2 + ℤ`).
- `FlatTorus L` is a compact connected metric group; the quotient map is a covering map and a local isometry on balls of radius ρ.
- For a measurable `L`-periodic `g ≥ 0` on `E`, `∫_X g dμ_X` equals the integral of `g` over a fundamental domain.
- The unit torus has `ρ = 1/2` and total mass 1, and the coordinate map identifies `𝕋^d` with `UnitAddTorus (Fin d)` as additive groups by a measure-preserving equivalence; the norms differ.
- Scaling: for `c > 0`, `FlatTorus (c L)` is isometric to `FlatTorus L` with distances multiplied by `c` and measure multiplied by `c^d`.

**Checks.**

- The unit torus in dimension 2: the class of `(1/2, 1/2)` has norm `√2/2`, the class of `e_1` is zero, and ρ = 1/2.
- The lattice `2ℤ × ℤ` in dimension 2 has covolume 2 and ρ = 1/2 (the shortest nonzero vector is `e_2`).
- The supremum norm of `UnitAddTorus (Fin 2)` gives `1/2` at `(1/2, 1/2)`, not `√2/2`: identifying the two tori as metric spaces is wrong.
- A measure normalised to total mass 1 on `FlatTorus (2ℤ × ℤ)` violates the local axiom of §1.1: a ball of radius 1/4 has Lebesgue volume `π/16` but would get `π/32`.

(BGSS2023 lines 119–142.) *Needs:* §1.1, Mathlib `AddSubgroup.isClosed_of_discreteTopology`, `QuotientAddGroup.borelSpace`, `QuotientAddGroup.instNormedAddCommGroup`, `QuotientAddGroup.norm_mk`, `IsZLattice`, `ZSpan.fundamentalDomain`, `ZLattice.isAddFundamentalDomain`, `ZLattice.covolume`, `ZLattice.covolume_eq_measure_fundamentalDomain`, `MeasureTheory.AddQuotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage`, `MeasureTheory.IsFundamentalDomain.quotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage_quotientMeasure`, `MeasureTheory.IsAddFundamentalDomain.addProjection_respects_measure`, `measurePreserving_quotientAddGroup_mk_of_AddQuotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage`, `MeasureTheory.QuotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage.haarMeasure_quotient`, `UnitAddTorus.measurePreserving_equivPiIoc`.

### 1.4 Shells and packings

Prove, for a flat position space with `0 ≤ r₁ ≤ r₂ < ρ` and `x ∈ X`: the shell `{y : r₁ ≤ ‖y − x‖ ≤ r₂}` has measure `ω_d (r₂^d − r₁^d)`, which is at most `d ω_d r₂^{d−1} (r₂ − r₁)`. Prove the packing bound: if `0 < ε ≤ 2ρ` and `x_1, …, x_N ∈ X` satisfy `‖x_i − x_j‖ ≥ ε` for `i ≠ j`, then `N ω_d (ε/2)^d ≤ μ_X(X)`. In particular, on a flat torus the closed hard-core set of §3.1 is empty for `N > covolume(L)/(ω_d (ε/2)^d)` (GST2013 line 873; BGSS2023 line 165).

**Checks.**

- Unit torus, d = 2, ε = 0.4: `ω_2 (0.2)² = 0.04π ≈ 0.12566`, so at most 7 particles fit and the hard-core set is empty for `N ≥ 8`.
- On `E` the shell `1 ≤ |y| ≤ 1.1` in d = 2 has area `π(1.21 − 1) ≈ 0.65973`.
- The hypothesis `r₂ < ρ` is needed: on the unit torus in d = 1 (ρ = 1/2, `ω_1 = 2`) the shell `0.4 ≤ ‖y‖ ≤ 0.6` is the set `0.4 ≤ ‖y‖ ≤ 0.5`, of measure 0.2, while the formula would give `2(0.6 − 0.4) = 0.4`.

*Needs:* §1.1, §1.3, Mathlib `EuclideanSpace.volume_ball`.

### Examples

The unit torus `𝕋^d` (ρ = 1/2, total mass 1) is the setting of BGSS2023 and of Layer 10; Euclidean space (ρ = ∞) is the setting of GST2013 and DengHaniMa2024; a rectangular torus `FlatTorus (aℤ × bℤ)` is the box of side lengths `a`, `b` with periodic boundary conditions.

## Layer 2: Elastic scattering

### 2.1 The scattering map

Define `HardSphere.scatter ν : E × E →ₗ[ℝ] E × E` for `ν ∈ E` by `σ_ν(v, w) = (v − ⟨v − w, ν⟩ν, w + ⟨v − w, ν⟩ν)`. For a unit vector ν prove: `σ_ν` is an involution; `σ_{−ν} = σ_ν`; it preserves `v + w` and `|v|² + |w|²`; `⟨v' − w', ν⟩ = −⟨v − w, ν⟩`, so it exchanges incoming and outgoing pairs and fixes grazing pairs and pairs with `v = w`; it is the orthogonal reflection of `E × E` (with the Euclidean product norm) in the hyperplane orthogonal to `(ν, −ν)`, hence has determinant −1 and preserves Lebesgue measure (GST2013 lines 843–847 and 1222–1227; BGSS2023 lines 125–131; DengHaniMa2024 lines 157–163). These are polynomial identities in `⟨v − w, ν⟩` and `|ν| = 1`, and the measure preservation is the determinant together with `MeasureTheory.Measure.map_linearMap_addHaar_eq_smul_addHaar`; they are API of the definition, not headline theorems.

API:

- Components: the tangential parts `v − ⟨v, ν⟩ν` and `w − ⟨w, ν⟩ν` are unchanged, and the normal components are exchanged: `⟨v', ν⟩ = ⟨w, ν⟩`, `⟨w', ν⟩ = ⟨v, ν⟩`.
- Galilean invariance: `σ_ν(v + c, w + c) = σ_ν(v, w) + (c, c)` for every `c ∈ E`; rotation equivariance: `σ_{Aν}(Av, Aw) = (A × A)(σ_ν(v, w))` for every linear isometry `A` of `E`.
- Swap: `σ_ν(w, v)` is the swap of `σ_ν(v, w)`.
- Agreement with `Submodule.reflection` on `WithLp 2 (E × E)` for the subspace orthogonal to `(ν, −ν)`, and `LinearMap.det σ_ν = −1` by `Submodule.det_reflection`.

**Checks.**

- d = 2, ν = (1, 0), `v = (0, 0.9)`, `w = (0.9, 0)`: `⟨v − w, ν⟩ = −0.9` (incoming), and `σ_ν(v, w) = ((0.9, 0.9), (0, 0))`; energy `0.81 + 0.81 = 1.62 + 0`.
- Head-on: ν = (1, 0), `v = (1, 0)`, `w = (−1, 0)` gives `v' = (−1, 0)`, `w' = (1, 0)`: equal masses exchange normal velocities.
- `v = w` is fixed, and so is any grazing pair, e.g. `v = (0, 1)`, `w = 0`, ν = (1, 0).
- Non-example: reflecting each velocity separately, `v ↦ v − 2⟨v, ν⟩ν`, sends `(v, w) = ((1, 0), 0)` to `((−1, 0), 0)` and changes the total momentum from `(1, 0)` to `(−1, 0)`.

*Needs:* Mathlib `Submodule.reflection`, `Submodule.det_reflection`, `MeasureTheory.Measure.map_linearMap_addHaar_eq_smul_addHaar`, `MeasureTheory.MeasurePreserving`.

### 2.2 Pre- and post-collisional variables

Prove that the map `Θ(v, w, ω) = (σ_ω(v, w), −ω)` is a measure-preserving involution of `E × E × S^{d−1}` (with `vol ⊗ vol ⊗ σ_S`) which preserves the hard-sphere kernel `((w − v)·ω)_+`, and that the swap `(v, w, ω) ↦ (w, v, −ω)` has the same two properties (the involution: GST2013 lines 394–400; the unit Jacobians of the two changes of variables: GST2013 lines 432–437; the hard-sphere kernel `b(w, ω) = (ω·w)_+`: GST2013 lines 674 and 1264–1268). Prove the total cross-section formula `∫_{S^{d−1}} ⟨k, ω⟩_+ dσ_S(ω) = ω_{d−1} |k|` for `d ≥ 1`, with `ω_{d−1}` the volume of the unit ball of `ℝ^{d−1}` (so `ω_0 = 1`). The value is an elementary computation of this roadmap, stated in none of the sources: write `k = |k| e` with `e` a unit vector; the polar decomposition behind `MeasureTheory.Measure.toSphere` gives `∫_{B(0,1)} g dvol = (1/(d + 1)) ∫_{S^{d−1}} g dσ_S` for `g` positively homogeneous of degree 1, and Fubini over `e^⊥ × ℝ` gives `∫_{B(0,1)} ⟨e, x⟩_+ dvol = ½ ∫_{B^{d−1}} (1 − |y|²) dy = ½ ω_{d−1} (1 − (d − 1)/(d + 1)) = ω_{d−1}/(d + 1)`; equivalently, the orthogonal projection onto `e^⊥` carries the measure `⟨e, ω⟩_+ σ_S` on the hemisphere `⟨e, ω⟩ > 0` to Lebesgue measure on the unit ball of `e^⊥`.

**Checks.**

- d = 3: `∫ ⟨k, ω⟩_+ dσ_S = π|k|`; d = 2: `2|k|`.
- d = 1: `S⁰ = {±1}` and σ_S is the counting measure (total mass `1 · ω_1 = 2`), so `∫ ⟨k, ω⟩_+ dσ_S = |k| = ω_0 |k|`; the computation gives `∫_{B(0,1)} ⟨e, x⟩_+ = ½ = ω_0/(1 + 1)` there.
- With the probability-normalised sphere measure the d = 3 value would be `|k|/4`; the convention that σ_S is the sphere measure `MeasureTheory.Measure.toSphere` of Lebesgue measure, of total mass `d·ω_d`, excludes it.
- At the witness of §2.1, `(w − v)·ω` changes from `0.9` to `(w' − v')·(−ω) = 0.9` under Θ, as required.

*Needs:* §2.1, Mathlib `MeasureTheory.Measure.toSphere`, `MeasureTheory.Measure.toSphere_apply_univ`.

### Examples

The head-on collision exchanges velocities; the oblique collision at ν = (0.8, 0.6) of relative velocity `(−1, 0)` produces relative velocity `(0.28, 0.96)` (§4.2).

### Dependencies

Mathlib only.

## Layer 3: Phase space, contacts and free transport

### 3.1 Hard-core phase spaces

Define `HardSphere.hardCoreSet ε N` as the closed set `𝒟̄^ε_N` of configurations `Z ∈ (Fin N → X × E)` with `‖x_i − x_j‖ ≥ ε` for all `i ≠ j`, and `𝒟^ε_N` the open set with strict inequalities (GST2013 lines 839–841; BGSS2023 lines 137–142; DengHaniMa2024 lines 150–153).

API:

- `𝒟̄` is closed, `𝒟` is open, both are invariant under relabelling and under translation of all positions by a common vector, and both are products of a position set with all of `E^N`.
- For `N ≤ 1` both are the whole space; for `0 < ε < ρ` the difference `𝒟̄ ∖ 𝒟` is null.
- Restriction: if `Z ∈ 𝒟̄_N` then every subconfiguration lies in `𝒟̄_s`.
- Relabelling by a permutation preserves `λ_N` (`MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_piCongrLeft`).

**Checks.**

- On `E`, d = 2, ε = 1: positions `0`, `(1, 0)` lie in `𝒟̄_2` but not `𝒟_2`; positions `0`, `(0.5, 0)` lie in neither.
- Unit torus, ε = 0.4: positions `π(0.05, 0)`, `π(0.95, 0)` are at torus distance 0.1, so the configuration is not in `𝒟̄_2`; measuring the distance of the representatives (0.9) would wrongly accept it.
- `N = 1`: `𝒟̄_1` is everything, since there are no pairs.

*Needs:* §1.1, Mathlib `MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_piCongrLeft`.

### 3.2 Contacts, contact normals and boundary pieces

Define the contact pairs of positions `X` as the pairs `{i, j}` with `‖x_i − x_j‖ = ε`; a contact matching when these pairs are pairwise disjoint; the contact normal `ν_ij = ℓ(x_i − x_j)/ε ∈ S^{d−1}` for `ε < ρ`; and the boundary pieces `∂^±(i, j)` of configurations whose only contact pair is `{i, j}` and with `±⟨v_i − v_j, ν_ij⟩ > 0` (BGSS2023 lines 148–152).

API:

- `ν_ji = −ν_ij`, `|ν_ij| = 1`, and on `E`, `ν_ij = (x_i − x_j)/ε`.
- Boundary pieces are pairwise disjoint, disjoint from `𝒟`, and null; the configurations of `𝒟̄` whose contact pairs are not a matching form a null set.
- Contacts, contact normals and boundary pieces are equivariant under relabelling and invariant under common translations.

**Checks.**

- Unit torus, ε = 0.3: `x_i = π(0.1, 0)`, `x_j = π(0.8, 0)` are in contact with `ν_ij = (1, 0)`; the difference of representatives `(−0.7, 0)` would give the wrong direction and length.
- On `E`: three positions `0`, `(1, 0)`, `(−1, 0)` with ε = 1 have contact pairs `{1, 2}` and `{1, 3}`, which share particle 1 and are not a matching.
- The configuration with `x_i = (1, 0)`, `x_j = 0`, `v_i = (1, 0)`, `v_j = 0` is in `∂^+(i, j)`; with `v_i = (−1, 0)` it is in `∂^−(i, j)`; with `v_i = (0, 1)` it is grazing and in neither.

*Needs:* §1.1, §3.1, Mathlib `MeasureTheory.Measure.addHaar_sphere`.

### 3.3 Contact scattering and time reversal

Define the contact scattering `σ_M(X, V)` that applies `σ_{ν_ij}` to `(v_i, v_j)` for every pair of the contact matching `M` of `X` and is the identity when there is no contact or the contacts are not a matching; define the reversal `ℛ(X, V) = (X, −σ_M V)` (GST2013 lines 1219–1227, the pre-image of a post-collisional configuration).

API:

- `σ_M` and `ℛ` are involutions of `𝒟̄`, preserve total momentum and kinetic energy (`ℛ` reverses the momentum), commute with relabelling, and preserve `λ_N`; `ℛ` agrees with `(X, V) ↦ (X, −V)` outside a null set.
- `σ_M` exchanges `∂^+(i, j)` and `∂^−(i, j)`; `ℛ` maps `∂^+(i, j)` to itself.

**Checks.**

- On `E`, ε = 1, `x_1 = (1, 0)`, `x_2 = 0`, `V = ((1, 0), 0)` (outgoing): `σ_M V = (0, (1, 0))` and `ℛ(X, V) = (X, (0, (−1, 0)))`, again outgoing.
- With no contact, `ℛ(X, V) = (X, −V)`.
- Non-example: `(X, V) ↦ (X, −V)` sends the outgoing state above to the incoming state `((−1, 0), 0)`, which is not a state of any right-continuous trajectory.

*Needs:* §2.1, §3.2.

### 3.4 Free transport

Define the free flow `S_t(X, V) = (X + π(t V), V)` on `(X × E)^N`, componentwise (GST2013 lines 836–837; BGSS2023 lines 122–123).

API:

- `S_0 = id`, `S_{s+t} = S_s ∘ S_t`, `(t, Z) ↦ S_t Z` is continuous, and `S` is a `Flow` on `(X × E)^N`.
- Each `S_t` preserves `λ_N` and commutes with relabelling and with the common translations `A_y(X, V) = (X + y, V)`, `y ∈ X` (every position moved by `y`). The Galilean boost `B_c(X, V) = (X, V + c)`, `c ∈ E`, does not commute with `S_t`; it satisfies `S_t ∘ B_c = A_{π(t c)} ∘ B_c ∘ S_t`, the free case of the boost of trajectories in §5.3.
- On `E^N × E^N`, `S` is `TauCeti.flowOfLipschitz` of the vector field `(X, V) ↦ (V, 0)`.
- `S_t` does not preserve `𝒟̄` in general.

**Checks.**

- Unit torus, d = 2: `S_1(π 0, e_1) = (π 0, e_1)`.
- On `E`: `S_2(0, (1, 0)) = ((2, 0), (1, 0))`.
- Non-example for `𝒟̄`: on `E`, positions `(2, 0)`, `0` with velocities `(−1, 0)`, `0` and ε = 1 leave `𝒟̄_2` at time `t = 1.5`, where the distance is 0.5.
- The boost needs the position correction: one particle on `E` with `d = 1`, `x = v = 0`, `t = c = 1` gives `S_1 B_1(0, 0) = (1, 1)` but `B_1 S_1(0, 0) = (0, 1)`; the corrected right side `A_1 B_1 S_1(0, 0) = (1, 1)` agrees.

*Needs:* §1.1, Mathlib `Flow`, `MeasureTheory.MeasurePreserving`, Tau Ceti `TauCeti.flowOfLipschitz`.

### 3.5 Collision invariants of configurations

Define total momentum `P(V) = Σ_i v_i` and kinetic energy `H(V) = ½ Σ_i |v_i|²`. Prove that `σ_M` and `S_t` preserve both, and that the velocity ball `{|V|² ≤ R²}` is preserved by `σ_M` (GST2013 (2.1.3), lines 396–399).

**Checks.**

- At the witness of §2.1 the momentum `(0.9, 0.9)` and energy `0.81` are unchanged.
- The free flow changes positions but not `P` or `H`.
- Non-example: the separate reflection of §2.1 preserves `H` but not `P`.

*Needs:* §2.1, §3.3, §3.4.

### Examples

For `N = 1` everything reduces to free transport; for `N = 2` on `E` the contact set is the cylinder `{|x_1 − x_2| = ε}`.

### Dependencies

Layers 1–2.

## Layer 4: The two-body problem

Throughout this layer `a ∈ E` is a relative position with `|a| ≥ ε` and `u ∈ E` a relative velocity. The relative motion of two hard spheres is a point particle reflected at the sphere of radius ε; Layer 6 uses it for each pair of particles through the short lift.

### 4.1 Collision time

Define `D(a, u) = ⟨a, u⟩² − |u|²(|a|² − ε²)` and, when `⟨a, u⟩ < 0` and `D ≥ 0`, the collision time `τ(a, u) = (−⟨a, u⟩ − √D)/|u|²`. Prove that `τ` is the least `s ≥ 0` with `|a + s u| = ε`, that at the contact point `q = a + τ u` one has `⟨q, u⟩ = −√D`, so the collision is non-grazing exactly when `D > 0`, that no contact occurs in `[0, ∞)` when `⟨a, u⟩ ≥ 0` and `|a| > ε` or when `D < 0`, and that `τ` is smooth on the open set `{|a| > ε, ⟨a, u⟩ < 0, D > 0}`. Prove separation: if `⟨a, u⟩ ≥ 0` then `s ↦ |a + s u|` is nondecreasing on `[0, ∞)`, so after an outgoing collision two particles never meet again under free motion (GST2013 lines 846–847 and 1210–1216).

**Checks.**

- ε = 1, `a = (2, 0)`, `u = (−1, 0)`: `D = 1`, `τ = 1`, `q = (1, 0)`, `⟨q, u⟩ = −1`.
- Grazing: `a = (1, 3)`, `u = (0, −1)`: `D = 0`, tangent contact at `q = (1, 0)` at time 3.
- Miss: `a = (2, 3)`, `u = (0, −1)`: `D = −3 < 0`, no contact.
- The larger root `(−⟨a, u⟩ + √D)/|u|²` is the exit time of the straight line from the ball and is not a collision: at `a = (2, 0)`, `u = (−1, 0)` it is 3, where the line would be at `(−1, 0)` after crossing the ball.

*Needs:* Mathlib `EuclideanSpace`.

### 4.2 The two-body map

Define `B_s(a, u)` for `s ≥ 0` on `{|a| ≥ ε}`: if a non-grazing collision occurs at `τ ≤ s`, then `B_s(a, u) = (q + (s − τ) R_q u, R_q u)` with `R_q u = u − 2⟨u, q/ε⟩ q/ε`; otherwise `B_s(a, u) = (a + s u, u)`. This is the relative part of the two-particle dynamics under the right-continuous convention (GST2013 lines 842–847; BGSS2023 lines 133–136).

API:

- `B_s` maps `{|a| ≥ ε}` into itself and preserves `|u|`; `B_0` is the identity off the incoming contact states.
- `B_{s+r} = B_r ∘ B_s` for `s, r ≥ 0` off the incoming contact states.
- Reversal: if `(b, u') = B_s(a, u)` with `|a| > ε` and no contact at time `s`, then `B_s(b, −u') = (a, −u)`.
- With `a` and `u` the relative position and velocity of particles `i, j`, the velocities after the collision are `σ_{q/ε}(v_i, v_j)`, and `v_i + v_j` is unchanged.

**Checks.**

- ε = 1, `a = (2, 0)`, `u = (−1, 0)`, `s = 3`: `B_3 = ((3, 0), (1, 0))`, while free motion would give `(−1, 0)`.
- Oblique: `a = (3, 0.6)`, `u = (−1, 0)`: `D = 0.64`, `τ = 2.2`, `q = (0.8, 0.6)`, `R_q u = (0.28, 0.96)` of norm 1; the naive rule `u ↦ −u` gives `(1, 0)`.
- Non-example: continuing the reflected line from the initial point, `a + s R_q u`, instead of from the contact point gives `(5, 0) ≠ (3, 0)` in the head-on case.

*Needs:* §2.1, §4.1.

### 4.3 The collision map and its Jacobian

On the open set `U = {|a| > ε, ⟨a, u⟩ < 0, D > 0}` define the collision map `C(a, u) = (a + τ(u − R_q u), R_q u)`, so that `B_s = S_s ∘ C` on `U ∩ {τ < s}` with `S_s(a, u) = (a + s u, u)`. Prove that `C` is smooth on `U` and that `det DC(a, u) = 1` at every point of `U`. Route: with `w = da + τ du` the differential of `Y + τ U'` (where `(Y, U') = C(a, u)`) is `R_q w`, and the differential of `U'` is `R_q du` plus a term depending only on `w`; in the coordinates `(w, du)` and `(dY + τ dU', dU')`, obtained by shears of determinant 1, the Jacobian is block lower triangular with diagonal blocks `R_q, R_q`, whose determinant is `(det R_q)² = 1` (`Matrix.det_fromBlocks_zero₁₂`). Consequently, for each fixed `s ≥ 0`, the derivative of `(a, u) ↦ B_s(a, u)` with `s` held fixed has determinant 1 on `U ∩ {τ < s}` (statement used in GST2013 line 883; DengHaniMa2024 lines 186–187; BGSS2023 lines 133–137).

**Checks.**

- At `a = (2, 0)`, `u = (−1, 0)`, ε = 1: `C(a, u) = (0, (1, 0))` and `S_3 C(a, u) = ((3, 0), (1, 0)) = B_3(a, u)`.
- Explicit derivative: at ε = 1, `a = (2, 0)`, `u = (−1, 0)`, in the coordinate order `(a_1, a_2, u_1, u_2)`, one has `dτ = da_1 + du_1`, `dq = (0, da_2 + du_2)`, and `DC` has rows `(−1, 0, 0, 0)`, `(0, −1, 0, −2)`, `(0, 0, −1, 0)`, `(0, 2, 0, 3)`, of determinant `(−1)(−1)(−1 · 3 + 2 · 2) = 1`; with `s = 3` fixed, `DB_3 = DS_3 · DC` with `DS_3` the shear of determinant 1, so `det DB_3 = 1`.
- The time must be fixed when differentiating: in d = 1 with ε = 1, on `{a > 1, u < 0}` the collision time is `τ = (a − 1)/(−u)`, the fixed-time map is `B_s(a, u) = (2 − a − s u, −u)` where `τ < s`, with determinant 1, but the variable-time map `(a, u) ↦ B_{τ(a, u) + 0.7}(a, u) = (1 − 0.7 u, −u)` has determinant 0.
- Non-example: the reflection of the velocity alone, `(a, u) ↦ (a, R_q u)` with `q` frozen, has determinant −1; the position correction `τ(u − R_q u)` is what restores orientation.

*Needs:* §4.1, §4.2, Mathlib `Matrix.det_fromBlocks_zero₁₂`.

### 4.4 Measure preservation of the two-body map

Prove that for every `s ≥ 0`, `B_s` is measure preserving from `vol ⊗ vol` restricted to `{|a| ≥ ε}` to itself, and is injective off the null set of incoming contact states. Route: split `{|a| > ε}` into `U_s = U ∩ {τ < s}`, the set `V_s` with no contact in `[0, s]`, and a null remainder (grazing data, contact exactly at time `s`); `B_s = S_s ∘ C` on `U_s` and `B_s = S_s` on `V_s` are injective with Jacobian determinant 1, so `vol(B_s(A)) = vol(A)` for measurable `A` inside either piece by `MeasureTheory.lintegral_abs_det_fderiv_eq_addHaar_image`; the images are disjoint (characterised by whether the backward free path meets the sphere within time `s`) and cover the target up to the reversal of the null remainder (statement used in GST2013 line 883; DengHaniMa2024 Proposition 1.2(3), lines 186–187).

**Checks.**

- s = 0: `B_0` is the identity off incoming contact states.
- Grazing data `D = 0` form a null set: for fixed `u ≠ 0` it is the cylinder `{|a − ⟨a, û⟩û| = ε}`.
- Non-example: the totally inelastic rule, which replaces the relative velocity at contact by its tangential part `u − ⟨u, q/ε⟩q/ε`, sends the colliding states of `U_s` (a set of positive measure) into the set of states `(q + r u_t, u_t)` with `|q| = ε` and `u_t ⊥ q`, which has dimension `2d − 1` and is null.

*Needs:* §4.1–4.3, Mathlib `MeasureTheory.lintegral_abs_det_fderiv_eq_addHaar_image`, `MeasureTheory.Measure.addHaar_sphere`, `MeasureTheory.Measure.addHaar_submodule`.

### 4.5 Pair maps in the N-particle phase space

For `i ≠ j`, `η > 0` with `ε + η < ρ`, and `s ≥ 0` with `2 R s ≤ η`, define the pair map `P^{ij}_s` on configurations with `ε ≤ ‖x_i − x_j‖`, `‖x_i − x_j‖ + 2 R s < ρ` and `|v_i|, |v_j| ≤ R`: write `a = ℓ(x_i − x_j)`, `u = v_i − v_j`, `w = v_i + v_j`, apply `B_s` to `(a, u)`, keep `w`, move `x_j` by `π` of the time integral of its velocity, and fix every other coordinate `z_k`, `k ∉ {i, j}`: the pair map changes only the pair block `(z_i, z_j)`, so pair maps of disjoint pairs commute, and free transport of the remaining particles is not part of it. Prove that in the coordinates `(x_j, a, u, w)` the map is the skew product `(x_j, a, u, w) ↦ (x_j + π(h(a, u, w)), B_s(a, u), w)` times the identity on the other coordinates, hence, by Fubini, the translation invariance of μ_X and §4.4, measure preserving from `λ_N` restricted to its domain onto `λ_N` restricted to its image and injective off a null set (the pair step of GST2013 lines 875–887).

**Checks.**

- On `E` with the head-on witness of the Conventions, `P^{12}_3` sends `x_1 = (2, 0)`, `x_2 = 0`, `v_1 = (−1, 0)`, `v_2 = 0` to `x_1 = (1, 0)`, `x_2 = (−2, 0)`, `v_1 = 0`, `v_2 = (−1, 0)`.
- On the unit torus, ε = 0.3, the pair `π(0.1, 0)`, `π(0.8, 0)` with relative velocity `(−1, 0)` collides at once through the short lift `a = (0.3, 0)`.
- The linear change `(v_i, v_j) ↦ (u, w)` has determinant `2^d`; it is applied at the source and inverted at the target, so the factors cancel, and the position change `(x_i, x_j) ↦ (x_j, ℓ(x_i − x_j))` is measure preserving on `{‖x_i − x_j‖ < ρ}` by the local axiom of §1.1.
- Other particles are not moved: for `N = 3` on `E`, d = 1, the map `P^{12}_1` with `ε = R = 1`, `η = 4` sends positions `0, 2, 20` with velocities `0.1, 0.1, 0.1` to `0.1, 2.1, 20`; the third particle stays at 20.

*Needs:* §1.1, §3.4, §4.4.

### Examples

The two-body problem in relative coordinates is the billiard outside the ball of radius ε; a pair on the torus uses the same map through the short lift as long as its separation stays below ρ.

Define `HardSphere.IsTrajectory ε J Z` for an interval `J ⊆ ℝ` and a path `Z = (X, V) : ℝ → (Fin N → X × E)`: for `t ∈ J`, `Z(t) ∈ 𝒟̄^ε_N`; positions satisfy `x_i(t) = x_i(s) + π(∫_s^t v_i)` for `s ≤ t` in `J`; velocities are right-continuous within `J` (at each `t ∈ J`, `V(t') → V(t)` as `t' → t` through `J ∩ (t, ∞)`, a vacuous condition at a greatest element of `J`) and constant off a set of contact times that is finite in every bounded subinterval; at every `t ∈ J` the contact pairs of `X(t)` form a matching and each contact pair is outgoing for `V(t)`; and at every `t ∈ J` other than a least element of `J`, `V(t) = σ_M V(t−)`, where `V(t−)` is the left limit within `J` (through `J ∩ (−∞, t)`). The values of `Z` outside `J` are not constrained (GST2013 lines 836–847; BGSS2023 lines 122–131; DengHaniMa2024 lines 140–172).

API:

- Restriction to subintervals, translation in time, and positions continuous with velocities piecewise constant; the left limit `V(t−)` within `J` exists at every `t ∈ J` other than a least element of `J`.
- Conservation: `P(V(t))` and `H(V(t))` are constant on `J`.
- Free motion between contacts: on an interval free of contact times, `Z(t) = S_{t−s} Z(s)`.

**Checks.**

- `N = 1`: `t ↦ S_t Z_0` is a trajectory on ℝ.
- The head-on witness of the Conventions is a trajectory on ℝ with the single contact time 1.
- Non-example: free motion through the contact (`x_1(t) = (2 − t, 0)` for all `t`) leaves `𝒟̄_2` after time 1.
- Non-example: the same path with left-continuous velocities (`V(1) = ((−1, 0), 0)`) violates the outgoing condition at time 1.

*Needs:* §3.1–3.4.

### 5.2 Uniqueness and gluing

Prove `HardSphere.IsTrajectory.eqOn`: two trajectories on `J` that agree at one time of `J` agree on `J`. Route: forward, both move freely until the first contact time of either; a pair that is incoming at that time and is not scattered enters `{‖x_i − x_j‖ < ε}` immediately, so both scatter at the same times; backward, `V(t−) = σ_M V(t)` determines the left limits because `σ_M` is an involution. Prove gluing: trajectories on `[a, b]` and `[b, c]` agreeing at `b` form a trajectory on `[a, c]` (DengHaniMa2024 lines 182–188; GST2013 lines 848–854).

**Checks.**

- For `N = 1` uniqueness is uniqueness of free motion.
- Two trajectories from the outgoing contact state `x_1 = (1, 0)`, `x_2 = 0`, `v_1 = 0`, `v_2 = (−1, 0)` on `[0, 2]` both give `x_2(2) = (−2, 0)`.
- Gluing at the head-on witness: the trajectory on `[0, 2]` and the trajectory on `[1, 3]` from the time-1 state agree on `[1, 2]` and glue to the trajectory on `[0, 3]` ending at `x_1 = (1, 0)`, `x_2 = (−2, 0)`.
- The proof does not use the outgoing condition, which only excludes grazing contacts: the same argument gives uniqueness for the weaker notion that admits grazing contacts (σ fixes grazing pairs), for instance for the two-body path tangent to the sphere at `q = (1, 0)` in §4.1.

*Needs:* §5.1.

### 5.3 Symmetries of trajectories

Prove that trajectories are carried to trajectories by: time translation `t ↦ Z(t + c)`; time reversal `t ↦ ℛ(Z(−t))` on `−J`; relabelling by a permutation of `Fin N`; translation of all positions by `π(c)`; and the Galilean boost `(X(t), V(t)) ↦ (X(t) + π(t c), V(t) + c)`. The relabelling statement is the indistinguishability of the particles (GST2013 (1.1.1), lines 211–215; BGSS2023 lines 184–187). Time reversal, common translations and boosts are consequences proved here from the definition of §5.1 and the identities of the scattering map and the contact scattering (§2.1: `σ_{−ν} = σ_ν` and Galilean invariance; §3.2: contacts are invariant under common translations; §3.3: `σ_M` is an involution exchanging incoming and outgoing pairs), whose input is the reflection law GST2013 (4.1.1)–(4.1.2), lines 835–847, printed p. 27.

**Checks.**

- Reversing the head-on witness gives positions `(1, 0)`, `(−2, 0)` at time −3 with velocities `0`, `(1, 0)`, which collide at time −1 and return to `(2, 0)`, `0` at time 0 with velocities `(1, 0)`, `0`.
- A boost by `c = (1, 0)` of the head-on witness gives the collision of velocities `0` and `(1, 0)`, still at time 1.
- Non-example: `t ↦ (X(−t), −V(−t))` without `σ_M` has left-continuous velocities and is not a trajectory.

*Needs:* §2.1, §3.2, §3.3, §5.1.

### 5.4 The left-continuous convention

For a trajectory `Z` on `J` write `M(t)` for the contact matching of `X(t)` and `Y(t) = (X(t), σ_{M(t)} V(t))` for `t ∈ J`. Prove: the velocities of `Y` are left-continuous within `J` and constant off the contact times of `Z`; at every `t ∈ J` other than a least element of `J`, `σ_{M(t)} V(t) = V(t−)`, the left limit within `J`; at a least element `t₀` of `J` the incoming state is by definition `Y(t₀) = (X(t₀), σ_{M(t₀)} V(t₀))`, and no left limit of the values of `Z` outside `J` enters; the contact pairs of `X(t)` are incoming for the velocities of `Y(t)`; and at every `t ∈ J` other than a greatest element, the right limit within `J` of the velocities of `Y` is `σ_{M(t)}` applied to the velocities of `Y(t)`. For a trajectory on ℝ the identity `Y(t) = (X(t), V(t−))` therefore holds at every `t`. Conversely, a path on `J` with values in `𝒟̄` on `J`, positions as in §5.1, velocities left-continuous within `J` and constant off a set of contact times finite in every bounded subinterval, whose contact pairs at every time form a matching and are incoming for its velocities, and whose velocities have right limit within `J` equal to `σ_{M(t)}` of their value at every `t ∈ J` other than a greatest element, is carried to a trajectory on `J` by the same map, `σ_M` being an involution. On `X = E` with `d ≥ 2` and `J = [0, ∞)` or `J = [0, T]`, the Euclidean setting of DengHaniMa2024 Definition 1.1 (lines 140–172, on the domain of lines 150–153), `Y` is the hard-sphere dynamics of that definition started from the incoming initial state `Y(0) = (X(0), σ_{M(0)} V(0))`, and a dynamics in the sense of that definition with the properties of the converse comes from a trajectory by the same map.

**Checks.**

- At the head-on witness, the left-continuous state at time 1 is `v_1 = (−1, 0)`, `v_2 = 0`.
- Off contact times both conventions agree.
- Applying the map twice returns the right-continuous path, since `σ_M` is an involution.
- Only the values on `J` count: for `N = 1`, d = 2, `J = [0, 1]`, the path with `x(t) = 0` for all `t`, `V(t) = 0` for `t ≥ 0` and `V(t) = e_1` for `t < 0` is a trajectory on `J`; at `t = 0` the incoming state has velocity `σ_M V(0) = 0`, while the left limit of the path from outside `J` is `e_1`; at every `t ∈ (0, 1]` the velocity `σ_M V(t)` and the left limit within `J` are both 0.
- The initial datum of DengHaniMa2024 Definition 1.1 is the incoming state: for ε = 1 the outgoing contact state `x_1 = (1, 0)`, `x_2 = 0`, `v_1 = 0`, `v_2 = (−1, 0)` of a trajectory at time 0 corresponds to the datum `v_1 = (−1, 0)`, `v_2 = 0`, which that definition scatters at `0+` back to `0`, `(−1, 0)`; started from the outgoing state itself, that definition would scatter it at `0+` into `(−1, 0)`, `0`, and the spheres would overlap at every small `t > 0`, at distance `1 − t`.

*Needs:* §3.3, §5.1.

### 5.5 Good configurations

Define `HardSphere.goodSet ε N` as the set `G` of `Z ∈ 𝒟̄^ε_N` such that some trajectory on ℝ passes through `Z` at time 0. Prove that `G` is invariant under trajectories, relabelling, reversal, common translations and boosts, and that `G` contains `𝒟̄_N` for `N ≤ 1`. Its complement in `𝒟̄` is the set of initial data leading to pathological trajectories (GST2013 lines 851–854).

**Checks.**

- `N = 2` on `E`: `𝒟̄_2 ∖ G` is the union of `{u ≠ 0, D(a, u) = 0}` (the line of relative motion is tangent to the sphere at some time) and of the contact states with `⟨a, u⟩ ≤ 0`.
- The incoming contact state of §5.2 is not in `G`; the outgoing one is.
- A configuration with a triple contact (three spheres pairwise touching in d = 2, positions forming an equilateral triangle of side ε) is not in `G`.

*Needs:* §4.1, §5.1–5.3.

### Examples

For `N = 2` the trajectory through a good configuration is explicit: the centre of mass moves freely and the relative motion is `B_t` forward and its reversal backward.

### Dependencies

## Layer 6: Alexander's theorem

### 6.1 The near-triple estimate

Prove: let `0 < ε`, `η > 0` with `ε + η < ρ`, `R > 0`, `K ⊆ X` measurable, and let `I` be the set of `Z ∈ 𝒟̄^ε_N` with all positions in `K`, `|V| ≤ R`, and distinct `i, j, k` with `‖x_i − x_j‖ ≤ ε + η` and `‖x_i − x_k‖ ≤ ε + η`. Then `λ_N(I) ≤ N³ μ_X(K)^{N−2} (ω_d((ε + η)^d − ε^d))² vol(B^{dN}_R)` (GST2013 Lemma 4.1.1, lines 864–874). Route: Fubini over `x_j` and `x_k` in shells around `x_i` (§1.4).

**Checks.**

- `N = 2`: there is no triple of distinct indices, so `I = ∅` and the bound holds trivially.
- The bound is of order `η²`: a single near pair has measure of order `η`, e.g. the shell `1 ≤ |x_1 − x_2| ≤ 1 + η` in d = 2 has area `π(2η + η²)`.
- On the unit torus with `K = X`, the factor `μ_X(K)` is 1.

*Needs:* §1.4, §3.1.

### 6.2 Short time steps

For `R > 0` and `0 < δ` with `ε + 4Rδ < ρ`, call a pair of particles at distance at most `ε + 2Rδ` a near pair (no other pair can come into contact within time δ, since relative speeds are at most `2R`), and let `S_{δ,R}` be the set of `Z ∈ 𝒟̄` with `|V| ≤ R`, no particle within `ε + 2Rδ` of two others, no contact state that is incoming or grazing, and no grazing collision in `[0, δ]` between near pairs. Prove: the near pairs form a matching; on `[0, δ]` each near pair collides at most once and no other pair comes into contact; the step map `Φ_δ` gives the trajectory on `[0, δ]`; and `Φ_δ` is injective on `S_{δ,R}` and measure preserving from `λ_N` restricted to `S_{δ,R}` onto `λ_N` restricted to `Φ_δ(S_{δ,R})`. Here `Φ_δ` is defined block by block: on the Borel piece of `S_{δ,R}` where the near pairs form a given matching `M` (finitely many pieces), it acts on the block `(z_i, z_j)` of each `{i, j} ∈ M` by the pair map `P^{ij}_δ` of §4.5 (taken with `η = 4Rδ`: a near pair has `‖x_i − x_j‖ + 2Rδ ≤ ε + 4Rδ < ρ`, so it lies in the domain of `P^{ij}_δ`) and on each particle `k` in no near pair by the one-particle free step `z_k ↦ (x_k + π(δ v_k), v_k)`. The blocks are disjoint, so these maps commute and each coordinate is moved exactly once; on each piece `Φ_δ` is a product of measure-preserving block maps, and the images of distinct pieces are disjoint because `Φ_δ` is the time-δ map of trajectories and two trajectories on `[0, δ]` that agree at time δ agree at time 0 (§5.2). The complement of `S_{δ,R}` in `𝒟̄ ∩ {|V| ≤ R}` is `I` of §6.1 with `η = 2Rδ` (admissible there, since `ε + 2Rδ < ρ`) together with a null set (GST2013 lines 875–887).

**Checks.**

- With `N = 2` and the head-on witness, `Φ_δ` for δ = 3, `R = 1` and ε + 4Rδ < ρ = ∞ reproduces `B_3`.
- The hypothesis `ε + 4Rδ < ρ` is what the pair maps need, and `ε + 2Rδ < ρ` would not do: on the unit torus (ρ = 1/2) with ε = 0.3 and `R = 1`, the step δ = 0.09 has `ε + 2Rδ = 0.48 < ρ`, but a near pair at distance 0.47 would need `P^{ij}_δ` at separations up to `0.47 + 0.18 = 0.65 ≥ ρ`, outside its domain; the step δ = 0.045 has `ε + 4Rδ = 0.48 < ρ`, its near pairs are at distance at most 0.39, and `0.39 + 0.09 = 0.48 < ρ`.
- Velocities stay in `{|V| ≤ R}` across a step, since `H` is conserved.
- Without the three-particle exclusion the step map is not the dynamics: particle 1 can meet particle 2 and then particle 3 within the step.
- Block composition: on `E` with d = 1 (ρ = ∞), ε = R = δ = 1, positions `0, 2, 20, 22` and all velocities `0.1` give `|V| = 0.2 ≤ R`, near pairs `{1, 2}` and `{3, 4}` (distance 2 ≤ ε + 2Rδ = 3, all other distances at least 18) and no collision, so the configuration is in `S_{1,1}` and `Φ_1` gives positions `0.1, 2.1, 20.1, 22.1`, the trajectory at time 1. Composing two `N`-particle maps that each also free-transport the particles outside their pair would move every particle by `0.2`.

*Needs:* §4.4, §4.5, §5.1, §5.2, §6.1.

### 6.3 Iteration

Prove, for `t > 0`, `R > 0`, a bounded `K ⊆ X` and every `δ > 0` with `ε + 4Rδ < ρ`: the set `F` of `Z ∈ 𝒟̄` with positions in `K` and `|V| ≤ R` that fail a step before time `t`, that is, for which some `j` with `0 ≤ j < t/δ` has `Φ_δ^i Z ∈ S_{δ,R}` for every `i < j` and `Φ_δ^j Z ∉ S_{δ,R}`, has measure at most `C(N, ε, R, K, t) δ`, with `C` independent of δ. Route: let `F_j ⊆ F` be the set failing first at step `j`, and `A_j` the image under `Φ_δ^j` of the configurations `Z ∈ 𝒟̄` with positions in `K` and `|V| ≤ R` that pass the steps `0, …, j − 1` (`Φ_δ^i Z ∈ S_{δ,R}` for `i < j`), so that `Φ_δ^j(F_j) = A_j ∖ S_{δ,R}`. By the injectivity and measure preservation of §6.2, `λ_N(F_j) = λ_N(A_j ∖ S_{δ,R})`. Velocities stay in `{|V| ≤ R}` and each particle moves at most `Rδ` in a step, so `A_j` lies in the set of configurations of `𝒟̄ ∩ {|V| ≤ R}` with positions in the closed `jRδ`-neighbourhood `K_j` of `K`, and `λ_N(F_j)` is at most the measure of the complement of `S_{δ,R}` in that set; this is an upper bound only, since `A_j` can be much smaller than that set. By §6.2 that complement is `I` of §6.1 for `K_j` and `η = 2Rδ` together with a null set, so with `K_t` the closed `Rt`-neighbourhood of `K` (bounded, and containing every `K_j` since `jδ < t`), `λ_N(F_j) ≤ N³ μ_X(K_t)^{N−2} (ω_d((ε + 2Rδ)^d − ε^d))² vol(B^{dN}_R) ≤ C₁ δ²` for `δ ≤ 1`, with `C₁ = N³ μ_X(K_t)^{N−2} (2R d ω_d (ε + 2R)^{d−1})² vol(B^{dN}_R)`. There are `⌈t/δ⌉ ≤ (t + 1)/δ` steps when `δ ≤ 1`, so `λ_N(F) ≤ (t + 1) C₁ δ`; when `δ > 1`, `λ_N(F) ≤ μ_X(K)^N vol(B^{dN}_R) δ`. Take `C` the larger of the two constants (the iteration of GST2013 lines 875–898, where `t/δ` is an integer, line 876).

**Checks.**

- On the unit torus with `K = X` every neighbourhood `K_j` is `X`, of mass 1, and the constant does not grow with `j`; for `K = {0}` the neighbourhood `K_0 = {0}` has mass 0 while `X` has mass 1, so the neighbourhoods are those of `K`, not all of `X`.
- The step-`j` bound is an inequality, not an equality: on `E` with d = 1, `N = 3`, ε = R = 1, δ = 2, `t = 3` and `K = {0}`, no configuration of `𝒟̄_3` has all positions in `K`, so `F_1 = ∅` and `λ_N(F_1) = 0`, while the configurations of `𝒟̄_3 ∩ {|V| ≤ 1}` with positions near `(−1.1, 0, 1.1)` lie in `K_1 = [−2, 2]` and in `I` (the middle particle is within `ε + 2Rδ = 5` of both others), a set of positive measure.
- On `E` with `K = B(0, r)` the neighbourhoods are `B(0, r + jRδ)`, contributing `(r + jRδ)^{d(N−2)}` as in GST2013 line 896.
- For `N = 2` the bound is 0 apart from the grazing null set.

*Needs:* §6.1, §6.2.

### 6.4 Alexander's theorem

Prove `HardSphere.volume_hardCoreSet_diff_goodSet`: for `0 < ε < ρ`, `λ_N(𝒟̄^ε_N ∖ G) = 0`. Route: a configuration that passes all steps of size δ on `[0, t]` has a trajectory on `[0, t]`, obtained by gluing the step trajectories (§5.2, §6.2); by §6.3, for fixed `t, R, K` the configurations with positions in `K` and `|V| ≤ R` that have no trajectory on `[0, t]` fail some step for every δ, so their set has measure at most `C δ` for every δ with `ε + 4Rδ < ρ` and is null; take the countable union over `t, R` and an exhaustion of `X` by bounded sets, and apply the reversal ℛ for negative times. Also prove that `G` is a Borel set and that `(t, Z) ↦ Z(t)` is Borel measurable on `ℝ × G`: the configurations with a trajectory on `[0, t]` are exactly the union over `m` and `R` of those passing all `m` steps of size `t/m` with velocity bound `R`, a finite intersection of preimages of the Borel sets `S_{t/m,R}` under the Borel step compositions, and on each such set the trajectory map is a finite composition of Borel maps (GST2013 Proposition 4.1.1, lines 862–863, proof lines 875–910; BGSS2023 lines 132–139; DengHaniMa2024 Proposition 1.2, lines 182–188; Alexander1976 Proposition 4.3, pp. 217–232, cited as reference [2] in GST2013 line 855, identified in its bibliography at lines 5439–5440).

**Checks.**

- `N = 1`: `G` is everything.
- `N = 2` on `E`: the exceptional set is the union of §5.5, null because the cylinder `D = 0` and the contact set are null.
- On the unit torus the exhaustion is trivial (`K = X`), and only `t` and `R` vary.

*Needs:* §5.3, §5.5, §6.3.

### Examples

The theorem holds verbatim on Euclidean space, on every flat torus, and in every dimension `d ≥ 1`; in dimension 1 a grazing contact is a pair of touching rods with equal velocities, and the exceptional set consists of such contacts and of multiple collisions.

### Dependencies

Layers 4–5.

## Layer 7: The hard-sphere flow

### 7.1 The flow

Define `HardSphere.flow ε N t` as the map sending `Z ∈ G` to the value at time `t` of its trajectory and fixing every `Z ∉ G`. Prove `HardSphere.flow_add`: `T_0 = id` and `T_{s+t} = T_s ∘ T_t` for all real `s, t`; each `T_t` is a bijection preserving `G`, `𝒟̄` and their complements; `(t, Z) ↦ T_t Z` is measurable; `t ↦ T_t Z` has continuous positions and right-continuous piecewise constant velocities; `T_t Z = S_t Z` for every `Z ∈ G` whose trajectory has no contact on the closed interval between 0 and `t` (off `G` the flow is the identity, so the membership is needed) (GST2013 line 862; BGSS2023 lines 132–139; DengHaniMa2024 lines 173–178).

**Checks.**

- `N = 1`: `T_t = S_t`.
- Head-on witness: `T_3` sends `((2, 0), 0; (−1, 0), 0)` to `((1, 0), (−2, 0); 0, (−1, 0))`, and `T_{−3}` sends it back.
- Non-example: defining the flow as `S_t` on `𝒟̄` leaves `𝒟̄` (§3.4) and fails to preserve it.
- The free identification needs `Z ∈ G`: on `E`, d = 2, ε = 1, the state `x_1 = (2, 1)`, `x_2 = 0`, `v_1 = (−1, 0)`, `v_2 = 0` has relative data `a = (2, 1)`, `u = (−1, 0)` with `D = 4 − 4 = 0`, a grazing contact at time 2, so it is not in `G`; there is no contact on `[0, 1]`, yet `T_1 Z = Z` keeps `x_1 = (2, 1)` while `S_1 Z` has `x_1 = (1, 1)`.

*Needs:* §5.2, §5.5, §6.4.

### 7.2 Measure preservation

Prove `HardSphere.measurePreserving_flow`: for every `t`, `T_t` is measure preserving for `λ_N` and for `λ_N` restricted to `𝒟̄`. Route: on `G ∩ {|V| ≤ R}` the map `T_t` is, on each set where the configurations at the times `jδ` lie in `S_{δ,R}`, a composition of step maps, which preserve measure by §6.2; these sets exhaust `G` up to a null set (§6.4); off `G`, `T_t` is the identity (GST2013 line 883; DengHaniMa2024 line 186).

**Checks.**

- `N = 2` on `E`: preservation reduces to §4.4 in relative coordinates and translation in the centre of mass.
- The indicator of `𝒟̄` is invariant exactly, since `T_t` preserves `𝒟̄`.
- Non-example: replacing specular scattering by the totally inelastic rule of §4.4 gives a map that sends the positive-measure set of colliding configurations to a null set, so the scattering law, not only free transport, carries the measure preservation.

*Needs:* §6.2, §6.4, §7.1.

### 7.3 Symmetries and conservation laws

Prove `HardSphere.flow_reversal` (`T_t ∘ ℛ = ℛ ∘ T_{−t}`), equivariance under relabelling, commutation with common translations of positions, and conservation of `P` and `H`, all exactly on the whole phase space (off `G` the flow is the identity and `G` is invariant under ℛ, relabelling and common translations, §5.5, so these identities hold there trivially). Prove Galilean covariance on the good set: for `Z = (X, V) ∈ G`, `c ∈ E` and `t ∈ ℝ`, `T_t(X, V + c) = (X' + π(t c), V' + c)` where `(X', V') = T_t(X, V)`; since `𝒟̄ ∖ G` is null (§6.4), it holds for `λ_N`-almost every `Z ∈ 𝒟̄`. The relabelling equivariance is the indistinguishability of the particles (GST2013 (1.1.1), lines 211–215; BGSS2023 lines 184–187); the reversal, translation and boost identities and the conservation laws are derived here from the symmetries of trajectories (§5.3), their uniqueness (§5.2) and the conservation along trajectories (§5.1), whose input is the reflection law GST2013 (4.1.1)–(4.1.2), lines 835–847, printed p. 27, with its conservation of momentum and energy GST2013 (2.1.3), lines 396–399.

**Checks.**

- At the head-on witness, `ℛ T_3 Z = ((1, 0), (−2, 0); 0, (1, 0))` and `T_{−3}` of the reversed initial state agrees with it.
- A permutation swapping the two particles of the witness conjugates the flow to the flow of the swapped labels.
- Non-example: rotating velocities alone does not commute with the flow: rotating the head-on witness's velocities by a quarter turn gives `v_1 = (0, −1)`, which never meets particle 2, while the rotated time-3 state has `v_2 = (0, −1)` after a collision.
- Galilean covariance needs `Z ∈ G`: boosting the grazing state of §7.1 (`x_1 = (2, 1)`, `x_2 = 0`, `v_1 = (−1, 0)`, `v_2 = 0`) by `c = (1, 0)` keeps the relative data, so both states lie outside `G`; `T_1` fixes the boosted state, with positions `(2, 1)`, `0`, whereas the covariance formula would give `(3, 1)`, `(1, 0)`.

*Needs:* §5.1–5.3, §6.4, §7.1.

### 7.4 The Koopman group

For `1 ≤ p < ∞` define the Koopman group `U_t f = f ∘ T_{−t}` on `Lp ℝ p (λ_N` restricted to `𝒟̄)` and prove that it is a `TauCeti.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup` of isometries. Route: isometry and the group law from §7.1–7.2 and `MeasureTheory.Lp.compMeasurePreserving`; strong continuity at 0 first for continuous compactly supported `f`, using that `T_t Z → Z` as `t → 0` for every `Z ∈ G` without contact (all but a null set), dominated convergence for `⟨U_t f, f⟩` and `‖U_t f − f‖² = 2‖f‖² − 2⟨U_t f, f⟩` for `p = 2` and comparison of norms on a set of finite measure for other `p`, then density (`MeasureTheory.MemLp.exists_hasCompactSupport_eLpNorm_sub_le`) (GST2013 lines 1138–1140; DengHaniMa2024 lines 175–178).

**Checks.**

- `N = 1` on `E`: `U_t f(x, v) = f(x − t v, v)`, the free transport group.
- For `N ≥ 1` the phase measure `λ_N|𝒟̄` is σ-finite of total mass `q_N · ∞` (with `0 · ∞ = 0`), where `q_N = μ_X^{⊗N}({X : ‖x_i − x_j‖ ≥ ε for i ≠ j})` is the measure of the admissible positions (the normaliser `Z^{can}` of §9.2); for `N = 0` it is the unit mass at the empty configuration. It can be infinite even on a torus, because velocities range over `E`: for `N = d = 1` on the unit circle there is no exclusion, `q_1 = 1`, `𝒟̄_1 = X × E` has measure `1 · ∞ = ∞`, and the constant 1 is in no `Lp`, `p < ∞`. The energy cutoff `f = 1_{H ≤ R²/2}` is: for `N = d = 1`, `R = 1`, its `p`-th power integrates to `μ_X(X) · vol([−1, 1]) = 2`, and `U_t f = f` exactly since `H ∘ T_{−t} = H`.
- Empty and null position sectors give phase mass 0, not ∞: on the unit torus with d = 2, ε = 0.4 and `N = 8` the hard-core set is empty (§1.4), `q_8 = 0`, the phase measure is 0, `Lp` is the zero space and `U` is the trivial group on it; on the unit circle with ε = 1/3 and `N = 3` the admissible positions are the equally spaced triples, a nonempty set of dimension 1, so again `q_3 = 0` and the phase measure is 0. The mass is infinite exactly when `N ≥ 1` and `q_N > 0`.
- Non-example: `p = ∞` is excluded. On `X = E`, for `N = 1`, the indicator `f` of `{x_1 ∈ B(0, 1)} × {|v_1 − e_1| < 1/2}` satisfies `‖U_t f − f‖_∞ = 1` for all small `t ≠ 0`, since free transport moves the position cutoff. The position cutoff must be one that transport moves: on the unit circle the ball `B(0, 1)` is all of `X` (every norm there is at most 1/2), so the same indicator depends on the velocity only, is invariant, and gives `‖U_t f − f‖_∞ = 0`.

### 7.5 The grand canonical phase space

Define the grand canonical phase space `𝒟^ε = Σ_{N ≥ 0} (Fin N → X × E)` with the componentwise flow and the measure `Λ = Σ_N (1/N!) λ_N` restricted to `𝒟̄_N` on the `N`-th component (BGSS2023 lines 158–166; DengHaniMa2024 lines 199–204). Prove that the componentwise flow is a group action preserving `Λ`, preserving the particle number and fixing the empty configuration.

**Checks.**

- The empty configuration has `Λ`-mass 1 (the `N = 0` term).
- On the unit torus with ε = 0.4 in d = 2, the components with `N ≥ 8` are `Λ`-null.
- The `N = 1` component carries `μ_X ⊗ vol` with weight 1.

*Needs:* §7.1, §7.2, Mathlib `Sigma.instMeasurableSpace`, `MeasureTheory.Measure.sum`.

### Examples

The flow preserves the σ-finite measure `λ_N|𝒟̄`. For `N ≥ 1` its total mass is `q_N · ∞`, with `q_N` the measure of the admissible positions (§7.4): it is 0 when `q_N = 0`, as on the unit torus with d = 2, ε = 0.4 and `N = 8`, and ∞ when `q_N > 0`, as for every `N ≥ 1` on `E` and for `N = 1` on every position space, since velocities range over `E`; for `N = 0` it is 1. On the unit torus its restriction to each energy sublevel `{H ≤ r}`, `r ≥ 0`, has mass `q_N · vol(B^{dN}(0, √(2r))) ≤ vol(B^{dN}(0, √(2r)))`, finite, and is invariant; on `E`, for `N ≥ 1` and `r > 0`, these restrictions are infinite, while for `r = 0` the sublevel `{V = 0}` is null and the restriction is 0. Every function of `P` and `H` is invariant.

### 8.1 Transported densities

For a measurable `W⁰ : (Fin N → X × E) → ℝ` vanishing off `𝒟̄`, define `W(t) = W⁰ ∘ T_{−t}`. Prove: `W(0) = W⁰`; `W(s + t) = W(s) ∘ T_{−t}`; `W(t)` vanishes off `𝒟̄`; `∫ W(t) φ dλ = ∫ W⁰ (φ ∘ T_t) dλ` for measurable `φ` with either side integrable or both functions nonnegative; `‖W(t)‖_p = ‖W⁰‖_p`; `W(t)` is symmetric when `W⁰` is; and `W(t) = U_t W⁰` in `Lp` (BGSS2023 lines 145–157; GST2013 lines 1138–1140; DengHaniMa2024 lines 233–234).

**Checks.**

- The indicator of `𝒟̄` is transported to itself exactly.
- `N = 1` on `E`: `W(1)((1, 0), (1, 0)) = W⁰(0, (1, 0))`.
- A density that is a function of `H` and `P` times the indicator of `𝒟̄` is constant in time.
- Non-example: `W⁰ ∘ T_t` (the wrong sign) moves mass in the direction `−v` for `N = 1`.

*Needs:* §7.1, §7.2, §7.4.

### 8.2 The weak Liouville equation with specular reflection

Call `φ : ℝ × (Fin N → X × E) → ℝ` an admissible test function when it is bounded and measurable, vanishes for `t` outside a bounded interval, has a material derivative `Lφ(t, Z) = d/dr φ(t + r, S_r Z)|_{r=0}` at every point that is bounded and measurable, and satisfies the specular condition `φ(t, X, V) = φ(t, X, σ_M V)` whenever the contacts of `X` form a nonempty matching `M`. Prove `HardSphere.weak_liouville`: for `W⁰ ∈ L¹(λ_N)` vanishing off `𝒟̄` and admissible `φ`, `∫_0^∞ ∫ W(t) Lφ(t) dλ dt + ∫ W⁰ φ(0) dλ = 0` (GST2013 (4.2.1) and (4.3.1), lines 911–918 and 941–958; BGSS2023 (1.1.3)–(1.1.4), lines 145–157). Route: for `Z ∈ G`, `t ↦ φ(t, T_t Z)` is continuous (the specular condition matches the values before and after each collision) and differentiable off the finitely many collision times in each bounded interval with derivative `Lφ(t, T_t Z)` (the one-sided derivatives at a collision time differ in general), so `intervalIntegral.integral_eq_sub_of_hasDerivAt_of_le` on each closed piece `[t_k, t_{k+1}]` between consecutive collision times (continuity on the closed piece, the derivative on its interior, interval integrability of the bounded measurable `Lφ`) gives `∫_0^∞ Lφ(t, T_t Z) dt = −φ(0, Z)`; integrate against `W⁰`, use Fubini and §8.1.

API of the test-function class:

- On `E`, a `C¹` function with compact support has `Lφ = ∂_t φ + Σ_i ⟨v_i, ∇_{x_i} φ⟩`.
- The class is closed under linear combinations and relabelling, and under multiplication by `a(t, P(V), H(V))` for every bounded measurable `a : ℝ × E × ℝ → ℝ` that is differentiable in `t` at every point with bounded measurable derivative `∂_t a`: free transport changes neither `P` nor `H`, so `L(a φ) = a Lφ + (∂_t a) φ`, and σ_M preserves `P` and `H`, so the specular condition survives. Boundedness of the multiplier is needed: `χ(t)` is admissible for `C¹` compactly supported χ, but `χ(t) H(V)` is unbounded.

**Checks.**

- `φ(t, Z) = χ(t) ψ(H(V))` is admissible for every `C¹` compactly supported χ and bounded measurable ψ, and the identity reduces to `∫_0^∞ χ' = −χ(0)` times `∫ W⁰ ψ(H)`.
- On `E` with `N = 1` the identity is the weak form of free transport `∂_t W + ⟨v, ∇_x W⟩ = 0`.
- The derivative at a collision time need not exist, which is why the fundamental theorem of calculus is applied with the derivative only on the open pieces: for the head-on witness and `φ(t, Z) = χ(t) θ(H(V)) ψ(⟨x_1 − x_2, e_1⟩)` with ψ bounded and smooth with bounded derivative and equal to the identity on `[−10, 10]`, and θ smooth with compact support and equal to 1 near `1/2`, the energy of the witness, the function is admissible (it is bounded; `Lφ = θ(H)(χ'(t) ψ(⟨x_1 − x_2, e_1⟩) + χ(t) ψ'(⟨x_1 − x_2, e_1⟩) ⟨v_1 − v_2, e_1⟩)` is bounded because `|v_1 − v_2|` is bounded where `θ(H) ≠ 0`; σ_M moves no position and preserves `H`), and `t ↦ φ(t, T_t Z)` is `χ(t)(2 − t)` for `0 ≤ t < 1` and `χ(t) t` for `1 ≤ t ≤ 10`: continuous at `t = 1`, with left derivative `χ'(1) − χ(1)` and right derivative `χ'(1) + χ(1)`. The energy cutoff is needed: without θ, at `χ(1) = 1`, `χ'(1) = 0`, `x_1 − x_2 = e_1`, `v_1 = M e_1`, `v_2 = 0` one gets `Lφ(1, Z) = M`, unbounded in `M`.
- Non-example: `φ = χ(t) θ(H(V)) ⟨v_1, e_1⟩`, with χ and θ smooth with compact support, is bounded with bounded material derivative `χ'(t) θ(H) ⟨v_1, e_1⟩` but violates the specular condition, and the identity fails for it. For `Z ∈ G` whose trajectory has exactly one collision on `[0, ∞)`, at a time `τ(Z) > 0`, the computation of the route gives `∫_0^∞ Lφ(t, T_t Z) dt + φ(0, Z) = χ(τ(Z)) θ(H)(⟨v_1, e_1⟩ − ⟨v_1', e_1⟩)` with `v_1'` the velocity of particle 1 after the collision, so the left side is the integral of this jump against `W⁰`, with a collision time that varies with `Z` (the data colliding at one fixed time form a null set, which carries no mass of an `L¹` density). Explicitly, on `E` with d = 1, `N = 2`, ε = 1, let `W⁰` be the uniform probability density on the box `x_2 ∈ (0, 0.01)`, `x_1 − x_2 ∈ (1.99, 2.01)`, `v_1 ∈ (−1.02, −0.98)`, `v_2 ∈ (−0.02, 0.02)`, and take χ = 1 on `[0.9, 1.1]` and θ = 1 on `[0.47, 0.53]`. Each trajectory has one collision, which exchanges `v_1` and `v_2`, at `τ = (x_1 − x_2 − 1)/(v_2 − v_1) ∈ (0.9519, 1.0521)`, and `H ∈ (0.4802, 0.5204)`, so the left side is `∫ W⁰ (v_1 − v_2) = −1 ≠ 0`.

### 8.3 Marginals

For a symmetric `W_N ≥ 0` vanishing off `𝒟̄_N` and `s ≤ N`, define the marginal `W^{(s)}_N(Z_s) = ∫ W_N(Z_s, z_{s+1}, …, z_N) dz_{s+1} ⋯ dz_N` (GST2013 (4.2.2), lines 929–932). Prove that it is symmetric, vanishes off `𝒟̄_s`, satisfies `W^{(s)}_N = ∫ W^{(s+1)}_N dz_{s+1}` for `s < N` (GST2013 (4.2.3), lines 934–937; at `s = N` there is no level `N + 1`), has `W^{(N)}_N = W_N` and `W^{(0)}_N = ∫ W_N`, commutes with relabelling the first `s` particles, and inherits the specular condition at every contact configuration of `𝒟̄_s` whose contacts form a matching when `W_N` satisfies it at all such configurations of `𝒟̄_N` (GST2013 line 938).

**Checks.**

- On the unit torus with `N = 2`, `0 < ε < 1/2` and `g(x, v) = g̃(v)` independent of position, `W_2 = g ⊗ g · 1_{𝒟̄_2}` has first marginal `g(z_1)(1 − ω_d ε^d) ∫ g̃`.
- `N = s`: the marginal is `W_N`.
- Non-example: dropping the indicator gives the first marginal `g(z_1) ∫ g̃` in the same situation, too large by the factor `1/(1 − ω_d ε^d)`; and the second marginal of the hard-core density vanishes at `x_1 = x_2`, while the product does not.
- The specular inheritance needs the specular condition on `W_N`; symmetry, positivity and support do not give it. On `E` with d = 2, ε = 1 and `s = N = 2`, the density `W = e^{−|v_1|² − |v_2|²} 1_{|v_1| ≤ 1} 1_{|v_2| ≤ 1} 1_{𝒟̄_2}` is symmetric, nonnegative and vanishes off `𝒟̄_2`, and its marginal of order 2 is `W` itself; at a contact with `ν_12 = e_1` and velocities `(0, 0.9)`, `(0.9, 0)` it equals `e^{−1.62} ≈ 0.19790`, while at the scattered velocities `(0.9, 0.9)`, `0` it is 0, since `|(0.9, 0.9)| ≈ 1.2728 > 1`. The Gaussian density `e^{−|v_1|² − |v_2|²} 1_{𝒟̄_2}` satisfies the condition and takes the value `e^{−1.62}` at both states.

*Needs:* §3.1, §3.2.

### 8.4 Symmetric expectations

Prove: for `s ≤ N`, a symmetric probability density `W_N` on `(Fin N → X × E)` and measurable `h ≥ 0` on `(Fin s → X × E)`, `∫ W_N Σ_{i} h(z_{i_1}, …, z_{i_s}) dλ = N!/(N − s)! ∫ W^{(s)}_N h dλ_s`, the sum over injective `i : Fin s → Fin N`, whose number is the falling factorial `Nat.descFactorial N s = N!/(N − s)!`. This is the fixed-`N` form of the distinct-label identity, the first equality of BGSS2023 (1.1.9), lines 241–266, printed p. 3, with the indicator `δ_{N ≥ n}` at line 249. Route: extend each injective `i` to a permutation of `Fin N` sending `1, …, s` to `i_1, …, i_s`; relabelling preserves `λ_N` (§3.1) and `W_N`, so each of the `Nat.descFactorial N s` terms equals `∫ W_N h(z_1, …, z_s) dλ = ∫ W^{(s)}_N h dλ_s` by Fubini and the definition of the marginal. The hypothesis `s ≤ N` is needed for the marginal `W^{(s)}_N` to exist; the count `Nat.descFactorial N s` is also correct for `s > N`, where it is 0.

**Checks.**

- `s = 1`, `h = 1`: both sides are `N`.
- `s = N`: both sides are `N! ∫ W_N h` for symmetric `h`.
- `s = 2`, `N = 3`, `h = 1`: both sides are `6 = 3 · 2`; a sum over all maps `Fin 2 → Fin 3`, injective or not, would give `9`.
- The count at `s > N`: for `N = 1`, `s = 2` there is no injective map `Fin 2 → Fin 1` and `Nat.descFactorial 1 2 = 0`, whereas `1!/(1 − 2)!` computed with truncated natural subtraction is `1!/0! = 1`.

*Needs:* §3.1, §8.3, Mathlib `Nat.descFactorial`, `MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_piCongrLeft`.

### Examples

For the canonical measure of §9.2 every marginal is constant in time; for a product initial density the marginals at time 0 are products away from the exclusion.

### 9.1 Maxwellians

Define `M_{β,u}(v) = (β/2π)^{d/2} exp(−β|v − u|²/2)` for `β > 0`, `u ∈ E` (GST2013 (2.2.5), lines 489–492). Prove that it is a probability density, equals `TauCeti.Probability.multivariateGaussianPDFReal u (β⁻¹ • 1)`, so that `vol.withDensity M_{β,u} = multivariateGaussian u (β⁻¹ • 1)`, and satisfies `M(v') M(w') = M(v) M(w)` for `(v', w') = σ_ω(v, w)`.

**Checks.**

- d = 1, β = 1, u = 0: `M(0) = 1/√(2π) ≈ 0.39894`, equal to `ProbabilityTheory.gaussianPDFReal 0 1 0`.
- `∫ exp(−β|v|²/2) dv = (2π/β)^{d/2}`, from `GaussianFourier.integral_rexp_neg_mul_sq_norm` with `b = β/2`; for d = 3, β = 1 this is `(2π)^{3/2} ≈ 15.7496`.
- Non-example: `exp(−β|v|²)` without the factor 1/2 has variance `1/(2β)` per coordinate, not `1/β`.

*Needs:* §2.1, Mathlib `GaussianFourier.integral_rexp_neg_mul_sq_norm`, `ProbabilityTheory.gaussianPDFReal`, `ProbabilityTheory.multivariateGaussian`, Tau Ceti `TauCeti.Probability.multivariateGaussianPDFReal`, `TauCeti.Probability.multivariateGaussian_eq_withDensity`.

### 9.2 Invariant measures and canonical ensembles

Prove: for every measurable `Φ : ℝ × E → ℝ≥0∞`, the measure with density `Φ(H(V), P(V)) 1_{𝒟̄}(X)` with respect to `λ_N` is invariant under `T_t`, by the measure preservation of §7.2, the invariance of `𝒟̄` (§7.1) and the exact conservation of `H` and `P` under the flow (§7.3). On a position space of finite measure, define the canonical measure `P^{can}_{N,β,u}` with density `Π_i M_{β,u}(v_i) 1_{𝒟̄}(X)/Z^{can}`, where `Z^{can} = μ_X^{⊗N}({X : ‖x_i − x_j‖ ≥ ε for i ≠ j})` is the measure of admissible positions, defined when `Z^{can} > 0`; prove that it is a probability measure and is invariant under `T_t`, being the case `Φ(H, P) = (β/2π)^{dN/2} exp(−β(2H − 2⟨u, P⟩ + N|u|²)/2)/Z^{can}` of the first statement. The fixed-particle-number (canonical) formalism is that of BGSS2023 lines 158–160, printed p. 2; the invariant densities and the Maxwellian canonical ensemble are derived here from §7.1–7.3 and §9.1.

**Checks.**

- `N = 1` on the unit torus: `Z^{can} = 1` and the canonical measure is `μ_X ⊗ M_{β,u}`.
- Unit torus, d = 2, ε = 0.4, `N = 8`: `Z^{can} = 0` by §1.4, and the canonical measure is not defined.
- On `E` with `N ≥ 1` the invariant measure `Π_i M(v_i) 1_{𝒟̄}` has mass `q_N · 1 = ∞`, the admissible positions having infinite measure, so only the unnormalised statement holds there; for `N = 0` it is the unit mass at the empty configuration, a probability measure.

*Needs:* §3.5, §7.1, §7.2, §7.3, §9.1.

### 9.3 Grand canonical measures

For `0 ≤ ε`, `μ > 0` and a measurable `f⁰ ≥ 0` with `∫ f⁰ < ∞` on `X × E`, define `HardSphere.grandCanonical ε μ f⁰` as the measure on `𝒟^ε` whose `N`-th component has density `(μ^N/(N! Z)) Π_i f⁰(z_i) 1_{𝒟̄_N}` with `Z = 1 + Σ_{N ≥ 1} (μ^N/N!) ∫ Π_i f⁰(z_i) 1_{𝒟̄_N}` (BGSS2023 (1.1.5)–(1.1.6), lines 167–181; DengHaniMa2024 Definition 1.3, lines 199–223). Prove `1 + μ∫f⁰ ≤ Z ≤ exp(μ∫f⁰)`, that the measure is a probability measure and is exchangeable, that on a flat torus `Z` is a finite sum for `0 < ε < ρ` (§1.4), and that for `ε = 0` the law of the particle number is `ProbabilityTheory.poissonMeasure (μ∫f⁰)`. When `∫ f⁰ = 0` the measure is the vacuum law for every `ε ≥ 0`: `Z = 1` and `N = 0` almost surely. When `∫ f⁰ > 0` and `ε = 0`, every event `{N = n}` has positive probability and, conditionally on it, the `n` particles are i.i.d. with law `f⁰/∫f⁰`, a probability density; this conditional statement is not made when `∫ f⁰ = 0`, where `f⁰/∫f⁰` would be `0/0`.

API:

- The probability of `N` particles in a measurable `A ⊆ 𝒟̄_N` is `(1/N!) ∫_A W⁰_N` with `W⁰_N = μ^N Π f⁰ 1_{𝒟̄_N}/Z`; the particle number has finite moments of all orders.
- Monotonicity: `Z` is nonincreasing in ε.

**Checks.**

- `ε = 0`, `∫ f⁰ = 1`, μ = 2: `Z = e²` and `P(N = 1) = 2e^{−2} ≈ 0.27067`.
- `Z ≥ 1 + μ∫f⁰` because the terms `N ≤ 1` feel no exclusion; on `E` with ε > 0 the inequality `Z ≤ exp(μ∫f⁰)` shows that no confinement is needed.
- Non-example: weights `μ^N` without `1/N!` make `Z` diverge for `ε = 0` and `μ∫f⁰ ≥ 1`.
- Zero density: `f⁰ = 0` gives `Z = 1` and `P(N = 0) = 1` for every ε ≥ 0, consistent with `poissonMeasure 0 = δ_0` at ε = 0; the normalised density `f⁰/∫f⁰` is `0/0` there (the zero function under the division convention of `ℝ≥0∞` and `ℝ`, of mass 0, not 1).
- Zero diameter is not a finite sum: on the unit torus with ε = 0, μ = 1 and `∫ f⁰ = 1`, every term `1/N!` is positive and `Z = e`; the finite-sum statement needs `ε > 0`.

*Needs:* §1.4, §3.1, §7.5, Mathlib `ProbabilityTheory.poissonMeasure`.

### 9.4 Invariance of the grand canonical measure

Prove `HardSphere.grandCanonical_flow_invariant`: on a position space of finite measure, for `0 < ε < ρ`, `μ > 0`, `c > 0`, `β > 0`, `u ∈ E` and `f⁰(x, v) = c M_{β,u}(v)`, the grand canonical measure is invariant under the componentwise flow. For general `f⁰` the measure is transported by §8.1 componentwise The equilibrium `f⁰ = M` and its invariant measure are named in BGSS2023 lines 479–483, the product identity `M(z₁')M(z₂') = M(z₁)M(z₂)` is BGSS2023 line 3539, and the transport is BGSS2023 lines 267–268; the invariance is derived here from §9.2 applied in each component.

**Checks.**

- On the unit torus with `f⁰ = M_{1,0}` the invariance is the special case `Φ(H, P) = e^{−H}` of §9.2 in each component.
- Mean velocity `u ≠ 0` is allowed: `Π_i M_{β,u}(v_i) = (β/2π)^{dN/2} exp(−β(2H − 2⟨u, P⟩ + N|u|²)/2)` is a function of `H` and `P`.
- Non-example: the radial non-Gaussian profile `g(v) = 1_{|v| ≤ 1}` is not invariant: in d = 2 at ν = (1, 0), `v = (0, 0.9)`, `w = (0.9, 0)` gives `g(v)g(w) = 1` and `σ_ν(v, w) = ((0.9, 0.9), 0)` gives `g(0.9, 0.9) g(0) = 0` since `|(0.9, 0.9)| ≈ 1.2728`.
- Non-example: a position-dependent profile is moved by free transport. On the unit circle (d = 1) take `f⁰(x, v) = ρ(x) M_{1,0}(v)` with `ρ(x) = 1 + 0.5 cos(2πx)`: the `N = 1` component of the measure has density `(μ/Z) ρ(x) M(v)` at time 0 and, after the flow for time `t`, `(μ/Z) ρ(x − t v) M(v)`; at `t = 1/4`, `x = 0`, `v = 1` the position factor changes from `ρ(0) = 1.5` to `ρ(−1/4) = 1`, and by continuity the two densities differ on a set of positive measure. Nonconstancy as a function is not enough: `ρ = 1 + 1_{x = 0}` is nonconstant but equal to 1 almost everywhere, so it defines the invariant Maxwellian measure.

*Needs:* §7.5, §8.1, §9.1–9.3.

### 9.5 Correlation functions

For the grand canonical measure and its transport, define `HardSphere.correlation ε μ f⁰ n t` by `F_n(t)(Z_n) = μ^{−n} Σ_{p ≥ 0} (1/p!) ∫ W_{n+p}(t)(Z_n, z_{n+1}, …, z_{n+p}) dz_{n+1} ⋯ dz_{n+p}` with `W_N(t) = W⁰_N ∘ T_{−t}` (BGSS2023 (1.1.10), lines 267–277; DengHaniMa2024 (1.11), lines 235–244). Prove `HardSphere.lintegral_sum_distinct_eq_correlation`: for measurable `h ≥ 0` on `(X × E)^n`, the expectation of `Σ h(z_{i_1}(t), …, z_{i_n}(t))` over injective `i : Fin n → Fin N` equals `μ^n ∫ F_n(t) h` (BGSS2023 (1.1.9) and (1.1.11), lines 241–266 and 279–288); the real-valued version holds for bounded measurable `h`. Prove that `F_n(t)` is symmetric, vanishes off `𝒟̄_n`, has `∫ F_n(t) = μ^{−n} E[Nat.descFactorial N n] < ∞`, the expected number of ordered `n`-tuples of distinct particles, which is `N!/(N − n)!` when `N ≥ n` and 0 when `N < n` (the indicator `δ_{N ≥ n}` of BGSS2023 line 249), and that the inversion formula `W_n(t) = μ^n Σ_p ((−μ)^p/p!) ∫ F_{n+p}(t)` holds almost everywhere with absolutely convergent series on a position space of finite measure when `f⁰(x, v) ≤ C₀ exp(−β₀|v|²/2)` with constants `C₀ ≥ 0` and `β₀ > 0` (BGSS2023 lines 229–237). Route for the convergence: the Gaussian bound and the conservation of `H` give the pointwise bound `W_N(t)(Z_N) ≤ μ^N C₀^N exp(−β₀|V_N|²/2)/Z`; integrating out `m` of `n + m` particles multiplies it by the volume factor `K = μ_X(X) (2π/β₀)^{d/2}` once per particle, `∫ W_{n+m}(t)(Z_n, z_{n+1}, …, z_{n+m}) dz_{n+1} ⋯ dz_{n+m} ≤ μ^{n+m} C₀^{n+m} exp(−β₀|V_n|²/2) K^m/Z` (the velocity space is not of finite measure, so the factor `(2π/β₀)^{d/2}` cannot be dropped); inserting this in the definition of `F_{n+p}(t)` bounds the series `μ^n Σ_p (μ^p/p!) ∫ F_{n+p}(t)` by `(μ C₀)^n exp(−β₀|V_n|²/2) Σ_{p,q} (μ C₀ K)^{p+q}/(p! q! Z) = (μ C₀)^n exp(−β₀|V_n|²/2) exp(2 μ C₀ K)/Z`, finite thanks to the factorial denominators.

**Checks.**

- `n = 1`, `h = 1`: `E[N] = μ ∫ F_1(t)`, constant in `t`.
- `ε = 0`, `∫ f⁰ = 1`: `F_n(0) = (f⁰)^{⊗n}` exactly (Poisson process).
- For the invariant measure of §9.4 every `F_n(t)` is independent of `t`.
- Vacuum: for `f⁰ = 0` the grand canonical measure is the vacuum law (§9.3), `N = 0` almost surely and `F_1 = 0`, in agreement with `μ^{−1} E[Nat.descFactorial N 1] = 0`; the quotient `N!/(N − 1)!` computed with truncated natural subtraction is `0!/0! = 1` at `N = 0` and would give `μ^{−1}`. For `f⁰` of positive mass the truncated quotient overstates `E[N]` by the vacuum probability `1/Z > 0`.
- `Nat.descFactorial 1 2 = 0` (a one-particle state has no ordered pair of distinct particles and contributes nothing to `∫ F_2`), whereas `1!/(1 − 2)!` with truncated subtraction is 1; `Nat.descFactorial 3 2 = 6`.
- The volume factor in the integrated bound: on the unit circle (d = 1) with ε = 0.1, μ = C₀ = β₀ = 1, `f⁰(x, v) = exp(−v²/2)`, `n = m = 1`, `t = 0` and `v_1 = 0`, the integrated density is `∫ W_2(0)(z_1, z_2) dz_2 = (1 − 0.2)√(2π)/Z ≈ 2.0053/Z`; it exceeds the value `1/Z` of `μ² C₀² exp(−β₀|v_1|²/2)/Z` without the volume factor and lies below the bound `K/Z = √(2π)/Z ≈ 2.5066/Z`.

*Needs:* §7.5, §8.1, §8.4, §9.3, Mathlib `Nat.descFactorial`, `GaussianFourier.integral_rexp_neg_mul_sq_norm`.

### 9.6 Initial chaos and the Boltzmann–Grad scaling

Prove: for `0 < ε < ρ`, `F_n(0)(Z_n) = (f⁰)^{⊗n}(Z_n) 1_{𝒟̄_n}(Z_n) p_ε(X_n)`, where `p_ε(X_n)` is the probability under the grand canonical measure that no particle lies at distance less than ε from any of `x_1, …, x_n`; hence `0 ≤ (f⁰)^{⊗n} 1_{𝒟̄_n} − F_n(0) ≤ n μ ω_d ε^d ‖ρ⁰‖_∞ (f⁰)^{⊗n} 1_{𝒟̄_n}` with `ρ⁰(x) = ∫ f⁰(x, v) dv`. Prove `HardSphere.boltzmannGrad_scaling`: in the scaling `μ_ε = ε^{−(d−1)}` and for `∫ f⁰ = 1`, `1 − ω_d ε ‖ρ⁰‖_∞ ≤ ε^{d−1} E[N] ≤ 1` (BGSS2023 (1.1.8), lines 211–217; DengHaniMa2024 (1.12), lines 246–252). Consequently, when ρ⁰ is bounded, `F^ε_n(0) → (f⁰)^{⊗n}` as ε → 0 at every configuration with distinct positions, and in `L¹`.

**Checks.**

- `n = 1`: `F_1(0) = f⁰ · P(B(x_1, ε) empty) ≤ f⁰`.
- On the unit torus with `f⁰ = M_{1,0}`, `‖ρ⁰‖_∞ = 1`; in d = 3 with ε = 0.01 the scaling gives `ε² E[N] ∈ [1 − 0.0419, 1]`.
- For the Maxwellian datum `f⁰ = M_{1,0}` on the unit torus, at coinciding positions `x_1 = x_2` the indicator vanishes and `F_2(0) = 0 < M(v_1) M(v_2) = f⁰ ⊗ f⁰(z_1, z_2)` for every ε > 0: convergence holds only off the diagonal. The strict inequality needs a datum that is positive there: for a datum whose velocity density has compact support, at velocities outside that support both `F_2(0)` and `f⁰ ⊗ f⁰` vanish.

*Needs:* §1.4, §8.4, §9.3, §9.5.

### Examples

On the unit torus, the Maxwellian grand canonical measure is the hard-sphere gas at equilibrium; its correlation functions are time independent and converge to products of Maxwellians in the Boltzmann–Grad limit by §9.6.

### 10.1 The empirical measure

Define `HardSphere.empirical ε μ t h` on `𝒟^ε` by `π_t(h)(N, Z) = μ^{−1} Σ_{i < N} h((T_t Z)_i)` for bounded measurable `h` on `X × E`, and the measure `π_t = μ^{−1} Σ_i δ_{(T_t Z)_i}` (BGSS2023 (1.2.4)–(1.2.5), lines 324–334). Prove `E[π_t(h)] = ∫ F_1(t) h` (BGSS2023 (1.2.6), lines 335–340) and `E[π_t(h)²] = μ^{−1} ∫ F_1(t) h² + ∫ F_2(t) h ⊗ h` (BGSS2023 lines 352–369).

**Checks.**

- For `N ≥ 1`, `π_t = (N/μ) · TauCeti.Probability.empiricalMeasureOfFintype` of the particles at time `t`.
- `h = 1`: `π_t(1) = N/μ` and `E[π_t(1)] = E[N]/μ`.
- The empty configuration gives the zero measure, which `empiricalMeasureOfFintype` (a probability measure) cannot represent.

*Needs:* §7.5, §9.5, Tau Ceti `TauCeti.Probability.empiricalMeasureOfFintype`.

### 10.2 The Boltzmann collision operator

Define `HardSphere.collisionOperator` by `Q(g, g)(x, v) = ∫_E ∫_{S^{d−1}} ⟨w − v, ω⟩_+ (g(x, v') g(x, w') − g(x, v) g(x, w)) dσ_S(ω) dw` with `(v', w') = σ_ω(v, w)` (BGSS2023 (1.2.1)–(1.2.3), lines 292–312; GST2013 (2.1.2), lines 385–393; DengHaniMa2024 (1.13)–(1.14), lines 258–282). Prove that for measurable `g` with `|g(x, v)| ≤ C exp(−β|v|²/2)` for constants `C ≥ 0` and `β > 0` the integral converges absolutely and `|Q(g, g)(x, v)| ≤ C' (1 + |v|) exp(−β|v|²/2)` with `C'` depending on `C`, β and `d` (route: by conservation of energy `|g(x, v') g(x, w')| ≤ C² exp(−β(|v|² + |w|²)/2)`, and `∫ (|v| + |w|) exp(−β|w|²/2) dw` is finite for β > 0); the split into gain and loss terms with loss term `g(x, v) ω_{d−1} ∫ |w − v| g(x, w) dw`; the weak form `∫ Q(g, g) ψ dv = ¼ ∫∫∫ ⟨w − v, ω⟩_+ (g'g'_* − g g_*)(ψ + ψ_* − ψ' − ψ'_*)` for measurable `ψ` of polynomial growth (GST2013 (2.2.1), lines 432–437); `∫ Q(g, g) ψ dv = 0` for `ψ ∈ span{1, v_1, …, v_d, |v|²}`; and `Q(M, M) = 0` for every Maxwellian.

**Checks.**

- `Q(M_{β,u}, M_{β,u}) = 0`, by §9.1.
- The loss term at `g = M_{1,0}` in d = 3 and `v = 0` is `M(0) · π · ∫ |w| M(w) dw = M(0) π √(8/π)`.
- The kernels `⟨w − v, ω⟩_+` of BGSS2023 and `⟨v − w, ω⟩_+` of DengHaniMa2024 give the same operator by `ω ↦ −ω`, since `σ_{−ω} = σ_ω`.
- The hypothesis β > 0 is needed: in d = 2 the profile `g(v) = 1_{|v| ≥ 1}` satisfies the bound with `C = 1`, β = 0, and at `v = 0`, for `w = r e_1` and ω = (1, 1)/√2 the outgoing velocities `v' = (r/2)(1, 1)` and `w' = (r/2)(1, −1)` both have speed `r/√2`; for `r > √2` the gain integrand equals the kernel `r/√2`, and since the same holds on an open cone of `(w, ω)` the gain integral is infinite.

*Needs:* §2.1, §2.2, §9.1, Mathlib `MeasureTheory.Measure.toSphere`, `GaussianFourier.integral_rexp_neg_mul_sq_norm`.

### 10.3 Mild solutions of the Boltzmann equation

Define `HardSphere.IsMildBoltzmannSolution f⁰ T f`, for `T ≥ 0`, a measurable `f⁰ : X × E → ℝ` and a jointly measurable `f : ℝ → X × E → ℝ`: there are `C, β > 0` with `|f(t, x, v)| ≤ C exp(−β|v|²/2)` for `t ∈ [0, T]`, and for every `t ∈ [0, T]` and almost every `(x, v)`, `f(t, x + π(t v), v) = f⁰(x, v) + ∫_0^t Q(f(s), f(s))(x + π(s v), v) ds` (BGSS2023 (1.2.1), lines 292–304; GST2013 (2.1.1), lines 380–384).

API:

- Initial value: a mild solution satisfies `f(0, x, v) = f⁰(x, v)` for almost every `(x, v)` (the case `t = 0`, where `π(0 · v) = 0` and the integral vanishes); in particular `f⁰` inherits the Gaussian bound almost everywhere.
- Restriction: a mild solution on `[0, T]` is a mild solution on `[0, S]` for every `0 ≤ S ≤ T`, with the same constants `C`, β.
- Characteristics: since `x ↦ x + π(t v)` preserves `μ_X` (§1.1), the identity is equivalent to `f(t, y, v) = f⁰(y − π(t v), v) + ∫_0^t Q(f(s), f(s))(y − π((t − s) v), v) ds` for almost every `(y, v)`.

**Checks.**

- `f(t) = M_{β,u}` for all `t` (independent of `x`) is a mild solution on every `[0, T]`.
- With `Q` replaced by 0 the definition is the free transport `f(t, x, v) = f⁰(x − π(t v), v)`. In dimension 1 this is the definition itself: `σ_ω(v, w) = (w, v)` for `ω = ±1`, so `Q ≡ 0`, and a mild solution is at each `t` almost everywhere equal to the free transport of `f⁰`.
- Non-example for the transport direction, on the unit circle (d = 1) with `f⁰(x, v) = (1 + 0.5 cos(2πx)) M_{1,0}(v)`: the wrongly signed `f(t, x, v) = f⁰(x + π(t v), v)` gives along the characteristic `f(1/4, π(0 + 1/4), 1) = f⁰(π(1/2), 1) = 0.5 M(1)` at `x = 0`, `v = 1`, `t = 1/4`, while the definition requires `f⁰(0, 1) = 1.5 M(1)`; by continuity the two sides differ on a neighbourhood of `(0, 1)`, a set of positive measure. (A spatially constant datum such as `M` does not discriminate: both signs give `M`.)

*Needs:* §1.1, §10.2.

### 10.4 Lanford's theorem as a proposition

Define `HardSphere.LanfordStatement d : Prop` on the unit torus `𝕋^d`, `d ≥ 2`: for all `C₀ ≥ 1` and `β₀ > 0` there is `T₀ > 0` such that for every continuous probability density `f⁰` on `𝕋^d × E` with `f⁰(x, v) ≤ C₀ exp(−β₀|v|²/2)` and `|f⁰(x, v) − f⁰(y, v)| ≤ C₀ ‖x − y‖ exp(−β₀|v|²/2)`, there is a mild solution `f` on `[0, T₀]` with datum `f⁰` such that, with `μ_ε = ε^{−(d−1)}`, for every `t ∈ [0, T₀]`: for every `n ≥ 1` and every bounded continuous `g` on `(𝕋^d × E)^n`, `∫ F^ε_n(t) g → ∫ f(t)^{⊗n} g` as ε → 0⁺; for every `n ≥ 1` and every sequence `ε_k → 0⁺`, `F^{ε_k}_n(t) → f(t)^{⊗n}` almost everywhere; and for every compact `K ⊆ 𝕋^d × E`, the essential supremum over `K` of `|F^ε_1(t) − f(t)|` tends to 0 (BGSS2023 Theorem 1, lines 316–321; GST2013 Theorem 4 and Remark 3.1.1, lines 668–696, and Theorem 8, lines 2069–2080; Lanford1975). The proposition is the theorem proved by the roadmap on the BBGKY hierarchy; this roadmap proves its consequences.

API:

- At `t = 0` every conclusion holds, by §9.6.
- The proposition implies the law of large numbers of §10.5.

**Checks.**

- The quantifier order gives `T₀` depending only on `d`, `C₀`, `β₀`, as in BGSS2023 line 319.
- For a Maxwellian datum `f⁰ = M_{β₀,0}` (admissible when `C₀ ≥ (β₀/2π)^{d/2}`) the solution is `f(t) = f⁰`, the correlation functions are independent of `t` by §9.4–9.5, and every conclusion holds by §9.6; the proposition is consistent at equilibrium.
- The almost-everywhere conclusion is stated along sequences: along the filter ε → 0⁺ it would depend on the choice of representatives of uncountably many functions.

*Needs:* §1.3, §9.5, §10.3.

### 10.5 The law of large numbers

Prove `HardSphere.tendsto_empirical_of_correlation`: on a flat position space, let `f⁰ ≥ 0` be integrable, `t ∈ ℝ`, `μ_ε → ∞` as ε → 0⁺, and `f : X × E → ℝ` integrable; if for every bounded continuous `g` on `X × E` and `g₂` on `(X × E)²`, `∫ F^ε_1(t) g → ∫ f g` and `∫ F^ε_2(t) g₂ → ∫ f ⊗ f g₂`, then for every bounded continuous `h` and every δ > 0, `P_ε(|π^ε_t(h) − ∫ f h| ≥ δ) → 0` (BGSS2023 Corollary 1.2.1, lines 344–349, proof lines 352–371). Route: the variance identity of §10.1 gives `E[(π_t(h) − ∫ f h)²] = μ^{−1}∫F_1 h² + ∫F_2 h⊗h − 2(∫f h)(∫F_1 h) + (∫ f h)² → 0`; conclude with `ProbabilityTheory.meas_ge_le_variance_div_sq`. Prove the corollary `HardSphere.LanfordStatement.tendsto_empirical`: for `d ≥ 2` (so that `μ_ε = ε^{−(d−1)} → ∞`) and under `HardSphere.LanfordStatement d`, the empirical measure of the hard-sphere gas on `𝕋^d` started from the grand canonical measure concentrates on the Boltzmann solution for every `t ∈ [0, T₀]`.

**Checks.**

- At the Maxwellian equilibrium on the unit torus in dimension `d ≥ 2`, where `μ_ε = ε^{−(d−1)} → ∞`, the hypotheses hold with `f = M` by §9.4 and §9.6, and the conclusion is a law of large numbers for a stationary gas.
- Non-example in dimension 1: there `μ_ε = ε⁰ = 1` does not tend to ∞. On the unit circle with `f⁰ = M_{1,0}`, each term `(1/N!) μ_X^{⊗N}(𝒟̄^ε_N)` of the partition function increases to `1/N!` as ε → 0 and is dominated by it, so `Z_ε → e` and `P_ε(N = 1) = 1/Z_ε → e^{−1}`; for `h = 1` one has `π^ε_t(1) = N` and `∫ f h = 1`, so with δ = 1/2, `P_ε(|π^ε_t(1) − 1| ≥ 1/2) = P_ε(N ≠ 1) → 1 − e^{−1} ≈ 0.63212`, not 0, although the correlation functions converge by §9.6.
- `ε = 0` (Poisson process with intensity `μ f⁰`): `Var(π(h)) = μ^{−1} ∫ f⁰ h²` exactly, which tends to 0.
- Non-example: convergence of `F_1` alone does not suffice. If `F^ε_1(t) → f` but `F^ε_2(t) → 2 f ⊗ f`, the variance tends to `0 + 2m² − 2m² + m² = m²` with `m = ∫ f h`, which is positive whenever `m ≠ 0`.

*Needs:* §9.5, §10.1, §10.4, Mathlib `ProbabilityTheory.meas_ge_le_variance_div_sq`.

### Examples

In dimension `d ≥ 2` the stationary Maxwellian gas on the unit torus satisfies the law of large numbers with no further hypothesis (§9.4–9.6 and §10.5); in dimension 1 the Boltzmann–Grad scaling keeps `μ_ε = 1`, the particle number converges in law to `ProbabilityTheory.poissonMeasure 1`, and the law of large numbers fails (Checks of §10.5). Out of equilibrium, for `d ≥ 2`, the law of large numbers holds on `[0, T₀]` under `HardSphere.LanfordStatement d`.

## Worked examples

**Head-on collision on `E`, d = 2, ε = 1.** Start at `x_1 = (2, 0)`, `x_2 = 0`, `v_1 = (−1, 0)`, `v_2 = 0`. In relative coordinates `a = (2, 0)`, `u = (−1, 0)`, `D = 1`, `τ = 1`, `q = (1, 0)`. The state at time 1 is `x_1 = (1, 0)`, `x_2 = 0`, `v_1 = 0`, `v_2 = (−1, 0)`; at time 3 it is `x_1 = (1, 0)`, `x_2 = (−2, 0)`, and `B_3(a, u) = ((3, 0), (1, 0))` is the relative state. The reversal of the time-3 state runs back to the reversal of the initial state.

**Contact through the torus.** On the unit torus with ε = 0.3, particles at `π(0.1, 0)` and `π(0.8, 0)` are in contact across the boundary, with contact normal `(1, 0)`; with relative velocity `(−1, 0)` they collide at once and leave with relative velocity `(1, 0)`.
