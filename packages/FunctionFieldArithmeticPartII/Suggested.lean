# Function field arithmetic, Part II: target signatures

The roadmap is README.md; this file is not the roadmap. It states the roadmap's headline
theorems against the pinned APIs, using affine root-chart and tensor-product carriers.

The following headline theorems are not statable at the pins with a few simple definitions:
* Relative regular root geometry lacks the finite-root stack and its morphism properties.
* The coherent infinite root stack, its fpqc quotient and arbitrary base change lack the
  coherent root pseudofunctor and the represented band-action quotient.
* Infinite affine coinvariants lack the coherent root-colimit coaction and its rational-character
  grading; constructing that coaction is a substantial roadmap target.
* The infinite DVR reduced gerbe, fpqc Kummer classification and non-fppf torsor lack the
  relative infinite gerbe and fpqc torsor groupoid carriers.
* The root Picard square quotient and signed adelic equivalence lack the root Picard stack,
  its degree components and the completed-lattice gluing functor.
* Symmetric lisse lines across collisions and their multiplication lack the root symmetric-power
  stack and its adic lisse coefficient category.
* Exterior-power cohomology of root symmetric powers lacks stack étale cohomology with these
  coefficients and its Frobenius action.
* High-degree Abel–Jacobi descent lacks the root Abel–Jacobi morphism and stack lisse descent.
* The normalized character sheaf in every integer degree lacks the graded root Picard stack
  and its lisse category with Frobenius.
* The ramified norm complex and its torsor obstructions lack the root multiplicative sheaf,
  its norm and their compatible torsor groupoids.
* Quadratic Frobenius trace comparison lacks the root Picard character sheaf and its trace.
