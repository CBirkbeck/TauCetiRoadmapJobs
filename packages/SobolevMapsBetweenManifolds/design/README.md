# Roadmap: Sobolev maps between manifolds

**Summary.** Build the first-order local Sobolev classes of maps between manifolds at the
generality of geometric function theory: continuous maps `f : M → N` whose local
representatives in charts lie in `W^{1,p}_loc`, `1 ≤ p ≤ ∞`, their weak differential `Df`, and,
when `M` and `N` carry Riemannian metrics and orientations and have one dimension `n`, the
operator norm `‖Df‖` and the Jacobian `J_f` defined by `(Df)^* vol_N = J_f vol_M`. This is the
class on which HeikkilaPankka2025 (lines 20–27) defines quasiregular maps. The construction
starts from vector-valued local classes `W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; F)` on open subsets of finite-dimensional
real normed spaces, built on Tau Ceti's weak Fréchet derivatives (`TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn`) and
its first-order space `TauCeti.W1p`. It proves their gluing and chain rules with no bound on the
derivatives of the `C¹` factors, identifies chartwise null sets with Riemannian null sets, and
ends with the extrinsic description through an immersion into a vector space and the class of
measurable maps into a closed manifold that Hajlasz2009 (line 28) defines through an embedding.
The headline theorems, with the labels by which consuming roadmaps cite them:

- **T1** (§1.3, §2.2–§2.4). On open subsets of finite-dimensional spaces, `W^{1,p}_loc` is a sheaf.
  It is preserved by precomposition with `C¹` local diffeomorphisms, by postcomposition of
  continuous members with `C¹` maps defined on an open set containing their values, and by
  postcomposition of arbitrary members with `C¹` maps of bounded derivative. Each comes with its
  almost-everywhere chain rule.
- **T2** (§3.1, §4.2–§4.4). For continuous `f`, membership of the local representatives in one
  atlas of each manifold gives membership in all charts. The weak differential exists and is
  unique up to a chartwise null set, and these are exactly the null sets of the Riemannian
  volume of every continuous metric. `C¹` maps belong to every class with `Df = mfderiv f`.
- **T3** (§5.2–§5.3). For `f ∈ W^{1,1}_loc(M, N)`: `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` iff
  `‖Df‖ ∈ L^p_loc(M)`. Comparable metrics change `‖Df‖` by the comparison constants.
- **T4** (§6.1–§6.4). The oriented Jacobian of linear maps between oriented inner product spaces.
  The Jacobian `J_f`, its chart formula, its sign laws, `|J_f| = normDet(Df)`, Hadamard's
  inequality `|J_f| ≤ ‖Df‖ⁿ`, `J_f ∈ L^{p/n}_loc`, and the Jacobian measure.
- **T5** (§8.2). For a `C¹` immersion `ι : N → V`, a continuous `f` lies in `W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)`
  iff `ι ∘ f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M; V)`. Then `D(ι ∘ f) = dι ∘ Df`, and `‖D(ι ∘ f)‖ = ‖Df‖` when `ι` is
  isometric.
- **T6** (§7.1). On an open subset of a Euclidean space with values in a Euclidean space, the
  class is the continuous members of the Euclidean class. There `Df` is the weak derivative,
  `‖Df‖` its operator norm and `J_f` its determinant.
- **T7** (§8.4). For a closed `N` and two `C¹` embeddings `ι₁`, `ι₂` into vector spaces, a map
  `u : M → N` has `ι₁ ∘ u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc` iff `ι₂ ∘ u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc`.

## Scope and ownership

This roadmap owns:

- the local Lebesgue classes `L^p_loc(s, μ)` on a topological measure space, and the
  vector-valued first-order local Sobolev classes `W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; F)` on open subsets of
  finite-dimensional real normed spaces. It owns their linear, coordinate and gluing API and
  their agreement with Tau Ceti's `TauCeti.W1p`;
- the chain rules of T1 on Euclidean domains, at every `1 ≤ p ≤ ∞`, and the behaviour of
  Lebesgue null sets under `C¹` maps;
- the identification of chartwise null sets with the null sets of the Riemannian volume, and
  local Lebesgue classes on manifolds;
- the vector-valued class `W^{1,p}_loc(M; V)` on a manifold, the continuous class
  `W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)`, the weak differential, and their chart, restriction, gluing and chain-rule
  API;
- the operator norm of the weak differential and the `L^p` characterisation;
- the oriented Jacobian of a linear map between oriented inner product spaces of one dimension,
  the Jacobian of a Sobolev map, Hadamard's inequality and the Jacobian measure;
- the Euclidean compatibility of T6, local retractions of `C¹` immersions, the extrinsic
  description of T5, the extrinsic class of measurable maps, and its independence of the
  embedding for a closed target (T7).

Already in the libraries, and consumed: Tau Ceti's weak derivatives and `W1p`, including the
global change of variables `TauCeti.W1p.compL` (bounded `DΦ`, `|det DΦ|` bounded below,
`p < ∞`), the scalar chain rule `TauCeti.W1p.hasWeakFDerivOn_comp` (a `C¹` function of one
variable with bounded derivative, `p < ∞`) and the measure-preserving chain rule
`TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn.comp_measurePreserving`. Also consumed: chartwise null sets
(`TauCeti.IsNullSet`), the Riemannian volume (`TauCeti.riemannianVolume`), manifold orientations
(`TauCeti.Manifold.Orientation`), the Riemannian volume form (`TauCeti.riemannianVolumeForm`) and
compactly supported extensions along embeddings
(`TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding.exists_contMDiffMap_extension_hasCompactSupport`). From Mathlib it
consumes `LinearMap.normDet` and the Whitney embedding `exists_embedding_euclidean_of_compact`.
The local and vector-valued statements here contain the library's global and scalar ones as
special cases. Each comparison is a Check.

It leaves to named roadmaps:

- [PDE](../PDE/README.md) Layer 1 owns the scalar Sobolev spaces of Euclidean domains, their
  embeddings and traces. They are consumed through Tau Ceti's `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn` and
  `TauCeti.W1p`.
- [GeometricCurrents](../GeometricCurrents/README.md) G6 owns the scalar local spaces
  `W^{j,p}_loc(Ω)` of every order, with finite-cover gluing. At `j = 1` this is the class of
  §1.2 with `F = ℝ`, as §1.4 proves through `TauCeti.W1p`.
- [PseudoholomorphicCurveAnalysis](../PseudoholomorphicCurveAnalysis/README.md) PH1.1 owns the
  planar classes of every order on open subsets of `ℂ` and on half-discs. At order one on an
  open subset of `ℂ` they are the classes of §1.1–§1.2 with `E = ℂ`. Its PH1.2 composition and
  change-of-variables theorems at order one on open subsets of `ℂ`, where `p > 2`, are the cases
  `E = ℂ` of §2.4 and §2.2 (a Check of each); here they hold for every `p` (for continuous
  members in §2.4) and in every dimension. Its PH4.1 owns `W^{k,p}_loc(Σ, M)` for maps from
  Riemann surfaces with `kp > 2`, a two-dimensional higher-order sibling in the range where
  Morrey's embedding applies.
- SobolevPolynomialApproximation §2.1 (composition with `C^k` diffeomorphisms with bounded
  derivatives, a bounded operator on the global `W^{k,p}(Ω)`) and SobolevDifferentialForms §4.1
  (pullback of Sobolev differential forms by `C¹` diffeomorphisms with `DΦ` and `DΦ⁻¹` bounded)
  own the global precomposition theorems for scalar functions and forms on Euclidean domains,
  with their norm bounds. At order one, and in form degree `0`, they are the global counterparts
  of §2.2 for `C¹` diffeomorphisms `θ : Ω' → Ω` with `Dθ` and `(Dθ)⁻¹` bounded, with the same
  derivative `Du(θ) ∘ Dθ`. §2.2 is the local, vector-valued statement, with no bound and no
  injectivity, and gives no norm bound.
- [TeichmullerGeometry](../TeichmullerGeometry/README.md) §7.4 owns planar quasiconformal maps,
  the weak Wirtinger derivatives and the Beltrami equation.
- [PseudodifferentialOperators](../PseudodifferentialOperators/README.md) §5.2 owns Sobolev
  sections of vector bundles over compact bases, a global normed carrier. The classes here are
  local and need no compactness.
- [RiemannianGeometry](../RiemannianGeometry/README.md) R4.6 owns the comparison of chartwise
  nullity with the Riemannian volume under its conventions (smooth, boundaryless, Hausdorff,
  second-countable manifolds with smooth metrics), through which it proves that the cut locus has
  Riemannian measure zero; R6 reuses the comparison for the focal set. §3.1 differs in asking only
  a continuous metric on a `C¹` Lindelöf manifold, possibly with boundary, and for a smooth metric
  it is R4.6's comparison (a Check). Its consequences (the almost-everywhere reformulation, the
  independence of the metric, and `TauCeti.riemannianVolume = volume` on a flat inner product
  space) are owned here.
- [DifferentialGeometry](../DifferentialGeometry/README.md) Layer 2 (orientations), 12.1
  (metrics on open subsets) and 12.4 (volume form and Riemannian measure) are consumed through
  their Tau Ceti implementations.
- [GeometricMeasureTheory](../GeometricMeasureTheory/README.md) G2 owns the area and coarea
  formulas. Mathlib's `LinearMap.normDet` is the unsigned Jacobian, and §6.1 compares the
  oriented Jacobian with it.
- SobolevMapsBetweenManifolds, Part II, described under Downstream consumers, owns the density
  of smooth maps (Hajlasz2009 Theorem 2.1, lines 129–130, for `p > dim M`, and lines 138–141 for
  `p = dim M`; Bethuel1991), traces, homotopy classes of Sobolev maps, Sobolev maps into metric
  spaces, higher-order classes `W^{k,p}_loc(M, N)`, bi-Lipschitz changes of variables
  (Ziemer1989 Theorem 2.2.2), approximate differentiability of Sobolev maps and the tangency
  `D(ι ∘ u) ∈ dι(TN)` for the extrinsic class.

Nash's isometric embedding theorem is not used: where an isometric embedding appears, isometry is
a hypothesis (§8.2).

## Conventions

- **Spaces.** `E`, `E'`, `F`, `F'`, `V`, `V'`, `V₁`, `V₂` are finite-dimensional real normed spaces
  with their Borel σ-algebras. Inner products are assumed where a statement says so (§1.4's
  comparison with `TauCeti.W1p`, metrics, Jacobians, Layer 7). On an open `Ω ⊆ E` the measure is
  an additive Haar measure `μ`. Every class and every weak derivative here is the same for all
  additive Haar measures (§1.2), so statements quantify over one.
- **Exponents.** `p ∈ [1, ∞]` as an extended non-negative real; `p = ∞` is included everywhere.
  At `p = ∞` the weak identities are proved through the finite-exponent tools on relatively
  compact subdomains, since `TauCeti.W1p.compL` and `TauCeti.W1p.hasWeakFDerivOn_comp` require
  `p ≠ ∞`. Witness: `log |x|` on `ℝ²` lies in `W^{1,p}_loc(ℝ²)` exactly for `p < 2`.
- **Manifolds.** `M` is modelled on `I : ModelWithCorners ℝ E H` with `I.Boundaryless` and
  `[IsManifold I 1 M]`; likewise `N` on `J`, with model space `F`, and `M'`, `P` on `I'`, `I_P`.
  Smooth manifolds are the main case. `C¹` is what the chain rules need, so it is the standing
  hypothesis. "A chart" is a member of `IsManifold.maximalAtlas`, and the class is defined
  through the preferred extended charts `extChartAt`. Second countability enters as
  `[LindelofSpace M]` exactly where it is used (existence of `Df`, the Riemannian volume, images
  of null sets in §3.3).
  No separation axiom is used.
- **Null sets.** No measurable structure is installed on a manifold. A null set is a
  `TauCeti.IsNullSet`: its image in every preferred chart is null for every Haar measure of the
  model. "Almost everywhere on `M`" means outside such a set. Statements involving a measure carry
  `[MeasurableSpace M] [BorelSpace M]` and use `TauCeti.riemannianVolume`, whose null sets are the
  same (§3.1).
- **Direction of the weak differential.** In charts `φ` at `x` and `ψ` at `f(x)`,
  `dψ_{f(x)} ∘ Df(x) ∘ (dφ_x)⁻¹ = D(ψ ∘ f ∘ φ⁻¹)(φ(x))`. Witness: on `M = N = ℝ` with the chart
  `φ(x) = 2x` on `M`, `ψ = id`, and `f = id`, the local representative is `y ↦ y/2` with
  derivative `1/2`, and `1 · Df · (1/2) = 1/2` gives `Df = 1`. Using `dφ` in place of `(dφ)⁻¹`
  would give `1/4`, and omitting the chart factors would give `1/2`.
- **Metrics.** Continuous Riemannian metrics are Mathlib's `Bundle.RiemannianBundle` with
  `IsContinuousRiemannianBundle`. A real inner product space carries its flat metric through
  Mathlib's `riemannianMetricVectorSpace`, and an open subset carries the restricted metric
  through `TauCeti.Manifold.instRiemannianBundleOpen`. A second metric on one manifold is carried
  by the copy `TauCeti.WithMetric`. `‖Df(x)‖` is the operator norm from `(T_xM, g_M)` to
  `(T_{f(x)}N, g_N)`. Witness: for `f = id` from flat `ℝ` to `ℝ` with the metric `4 dt²`,
  `‖Df‖ = 2`.
- **Volume.** `TauCeti.riemannianVolume` of a continuous metric on a Lindelöf manifold. On a real
  inner product space with its flat metric it is `volume` (§3.1). Witness: the unit square of
  `ℝ²` has volume `1` for the flat metric and `4` for `4(dx² + dy²)`.
- **Orientations and the Jacobian.** An orientation is a `TauCeti.Manifold.Orientation I M (Fin n)`
  with tangent orientations `orientationAt`. The volume form is
  `TauCeti.riemannianVolumeForm o`, fibrewise Mathlib's `Orientation.volumeForm`. The oriented
  Jacobian `J(A)` of a linear `A : V → W` is fixed by `A^*(vol_W) = J(A) vol_V`. Witnesses on
  `ℝ²`: `J(diag(2, 1)) = 2` for one orientation on both sides; `J(diag(−1, 1)) = −1` from the
  standard orientation to itself, and `+1` from the standard orientation to its negative. With
  the metric `4 dt²` on the target `ℝ`, `f = id` has `J_f = 2`.
- **Dimension.** `n = finrank ℝ E`. Dimension `0` is allowed and computed in the Checks: every map
  of a `0`-manifold lies in every class, `Df = 0`, and `J(A) = ±1`.
- **Totality.** The weak differential is a total function, `0` off the class. Statements carry
  the class as a hypothesis. On the class it is determined only outside a null set, so a value
  of `Df`, `‖Df‖` or `J_f` computed for a particular map in a Check or an example holds almost
  everywhere. Pointwise identities of linear algebra, such as `|J_f| = normDet(Df)` and
  `|J_f| ≤ ‖Df‖ⁿ`, hold everywhere.

- R4.6: the comparison of chartwise nullity with the Riemannian volume, for the smooth metrics on
  smooth, boundaryless, Hausdorff, second-countable manifolds of its conventions. It is used only
  in the agreement Check of §3.1; no proof here consumes it, since §3.1 asks only a continuous
  metric on a `C¹` Lindelöf manifold.

## How to read the build

Layer 1 defines the local Lebesgue classes and the vector-valued local Sobolev classes on open
subsets of finite-dimensional spaces. It proves their API and their gluing over arbitrary open
covers, and compares them with `TauCeti.W1p`. Layer 2 proves the behaviour of null sets under
`C¹` maps and the three chain rules of T1. Layer 3 is measure theory on manifolds: chartwise
null sets are Riemannian null sets, local Lebesgue classes are chartwise, and `C¹` local
diffeomorphisms pull null sets back to null sets. Layer 4 defines the vector-valued class
`W^{1,p}_loc(M; V)`, the continuous class `W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` and the weak differential. It
proves chart independence, the `C¹` case, restriction and gluing, and the chain rules on
manifolds. Layer 5 adds metrics and proves the `L^p` characterisation. Layer 6 is the Jacobian,
from linear algebra to the Jacobian measure. Layer 7 is the Euclidean compatibility. Layer 8
proves the extrinsic description through immersions and the independence of the embedding for
the class of measurable maps.

Layers 1 and 3.1–3.2 can be built at once. Layer 2 needs Layer 1. §3.3 needs §2.1. Layer 4 needs
Layers 1–3. Layer 5 needs Layers 3 and 4. Layer 6 needs Layers 4 and 5. Layer 7 needs Layers 4–6.
Layer 8 needs Layers 2, 4 and 5.

## Layer 1: local classes on Euclidean domains

### 1.1 Local Lebesgue classes

For a topological space `X` with a measure `μ`, a set `s ⊆ X`, an exponent `p` and a map
`g : X → B` into a normed group `B`, say that `g` is *locally `Lᵖ` on `s`*, written
`g ∈ L^p_loc(s, μ)`, when `g ∈ Lᵖ(μ restricted to K)` for every compact `K ⊆ s` (Mazya2011
§1.1). For `X = ℂ` with Lebesgue measure this is PseudoholomorphicCurveAnalysis PH1.1's local
`Lᵖ` condition.

- If `t ⊆ s` and `g ∈ L^p_loc(s, μ)` then `g ∈ L^p_loc(t, μ)`. Every `g` is in `L^p_loc(∅, μ)`.
- The class is closed under sums and scalar multiples. If `g ∈ L^p_loc(s, μ)` and `g'` is
  a.e.-strongly measurable on every compact subset of `s` with `‖g'(x)‖ ≤ c(x) ‖g(x)‖`
  almost everywhere on `s`, where `c` is bounded on every compact subset of `s`, then
  `g' ∈ L^p_loc(s, μ)`. In particular `A ∘ g` belongs for every continuous linear `A`. If
  `g = g'` almost everywhere on `s`, then the two have the same membership.
- If `μ` is finite on compact sets and `p ≤ q`, then `L^q_loc(s, μ) ⊆ L^p_loc(s, μ)`.
- If `X` is Hausdorff, open sets are measurable, `μ` is finite on compact sets and `g` is
  continuous on `s`, then `g ∈ L^p_loc(s, μ)` for every `p`.
- If `X` is locally compact and `s` is locally closed (for instance open), then
  `g ∈ L^1_loc(s, μ)` iff `g` is locally integrable on `s` (Mathlib's
  `MeasureTheory.locallyIntegrableOn_iff`).
- *Gluing.* If `X` is locally compact, `s = ⋃ᵢ sᵢ` with every `sᵢ` open, and
  `g ∈ L^p_loc(sᵢ, μ)` for all `i`, then `g ∈ L^p_loc(s, μ)`. A compact `K ⊆ s` is covered by
  finitely many compact neighbourhoods each inside one `sᵢ`.
- *Comparable measures.* Suppose that for every compact `K ⊆ s` there is `C` with
  `ν|_K ≤ C μ|_K` and `μ|_K ≤ C ν|_K`. Then `L^p_loc(s, μ) = L^p_loc(s, ν)`.

**Checks.**

- The identity of `ℝ` lies in `L^p_loc(ℝ)` for every `p`, and in `Lᵖ(ℝ)` for no `p`, since
  `∫ |x|ᵖ dx = ∞` and `x` is unbounded. A definition requiring global `Lᵖ` would reject it.
- `g(x) = |x|^{−1/2}` on `ℝ`: `∫_{−1}^{1} |x|^{−p/2} dx = 4/(2 − p)` for `p < 2`, which is `4` at
  `p = 1` and infinite at `p = 2`. So `g ∈ L^p_loc(ℝ)` iff `p < 2`, while
  `g ∈ L^∞_loc(ℝ ∖ {0})`, because compact subsets of `ℝ ∖ {0}` avoid `0`.
- On `s = (0, 1)`, `g(x) = 1/x` is bounded by `1/a` on `[a, b] ⊆ (0, 1)`, so
  `g ∈ L^∞_loc((0, 1))`. Yet `∫_0^1 dx/x = ∞`, so `g ∉ L¹((0, 1))`. A definition through
  bounded subsets of `s` rather than compact ones would reject it.
- For `X = ℂ` and Lebesgue measure the class is PH1.1's local `Lᵖ` condition, literally.

`MeasureTheory.memLp_top_of_bound`, `MeasureTheory.locallyIntegrableOn_iff`.

### 1.2 The class `W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; F)`

Let `μ` be an additive Haar measure on `E`, `Ω ⊆ E` open, and `1 ≤ p ≤ ∞`. A map `u : E → F` lies
in `W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; F)` when `u ∈ L^p_loc(Ω, μ)` and there is `U : E → (E →L[ℝ] F)` with
`TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn μ Ω u U` and `U ∈ L^p_loc(Ω, μ)` (Ziemer1989 Ch. 2 §2.1; Mazya2011
§1.1; HeikkilaPankka2025 lines 22–23). Such a `U` is a weak derivative of `u` on `Ω`, written
`Du`. It is unique almost everywhere on `Ω` (`TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn.ae_eq`).

- *Haar measure.* Membership and the weak derivatives are the same for all additive Haar
  measures on `E`. Two of them differ by a positive scalar
  (`MeasureTheory.Measure.isAddLeftInvariant_eq_smul`), which scales both sides of the defining
  identity and preserves local `Lᵖ`.
- *Null sets.* Modifying `u` or `U` on a `μ`-null set changes neither membership nor the
  weak-derivative relation.
- *Linearity.* Sums and scalar multiples of members are members, with
  `D(u + v) = Du + Dv` and `D(cu) = c Du`. For continuous linear `A : F →L[ℝ] F'`, `A ∘ u` is a
  member with `D(A ∘ u) = A ∘ Du`.
- *Coordinates.* Let `(f_j)` be a basis of `F` with coordinate functionals `f_j^*`. Then `u` is a
  member iff every `f_j^* ∘ u` lies in `W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; ℝ)`, and then `Du = Σ_j D(f_j^* ∘ u) · f_j`.
  For `F = F₁ × F₂`, `u` is a member iff both components are.
- *`C¹` maps.* If `u` is `C¹` on `Ω`, then `u` is a member for every `p`, with `Du = fderiv u` on
  `Ω` (`TauCeti.hasWeakFDerivOn_of_differentiableOn`). Constants are members with `Du = 0`.
- *Exponents and restriction.* For `p ≤ q`, `W^{1,q}_loc(Ω; F) ⊆ W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; F)`. For open
  `Ω' ⊆ Ω`, members on `Ω` restrict to members on `Ω'` with the same weak derivative.

**Checks.**

- The identity of `E`, for `E ≠ 0`, lies in the class for every `p`, with `Du` the constant `id`.
  It is not in the global `W^{1,p}(E)` for any `p`, since it is not in `Lᵖ(E)`.
- `u(x) = log |x|` on `ℝ²`: `u ∈ L^p_loc` for every `p` and `|Du(x)| = 1/|x|`, with
  `∫_{|x|<1} |x|^{−p} dx = 2π/(2 − p)` for `p < 2` and infinite at `p = 2`. So
  `u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(ℝ²)` iff `p < 2`. A definition that omitted the bound on `Du` would accept
  `p = 2`.
- The Heaviside function on `ℝ` lies in `L^p_loc(ℝ)` but in no class: a weak derivative `U` would
  satisfy `∫ U φ = φ(0)` for every test function `φ`, which fails for `φ` concentrating at `0`. A
  definition through the classical derivative almost everywhere, which is `0`, would accept it.
- The Cantor function `c`, which is `0` on `(−∞, 0]` and `1` on `[1, ∞)`, is continuous on `ℝ`
  with classical derivative `0` almost everywhere, yet it is not in `W^{1,1}_loc(ℝ)`. A member
  restricts to `(0, 1)` with a weak derivative integrable there, so a member continuous on
  `[0, 1]` is absolutely continuous on `[0, 1]`
  (`TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.absolutelyContinuousOnInterval`), and `c` is not
  (`TauCeti.not_absolutelyContinuousOnInterval_cantorFunction`). Nor is `c` in
  `W^{1,1}_loc((0, 1))`: it would be absolutely continuous on `[1/4, 3/4]` with derivative `0`
  almost everywhere, hence constant there, while `c(1/4) = 1/3` and `c(3/4) = 2/3`.
- For `E = ℂ` with Lebesgue measure, the class is PH1.1's order-one planar class at the same `p`,
  literally.

### 1.3 Locality and gluing (T1(c))

Prove the sheaf property (Mazya2011 §1.1). Let `(Ωᵢ)_{i ∈ ι}` be open subsets of `E` with union
`Ω`, and `u : E → F`. Then `u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; F)` iff `u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(Ωᵢ; F)` for every `i`.
More precisely, if `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn μ Ωᵢ u Uᵢ` for every `i`, there is `U` with
`TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn μ Ω u U` and `U = Uᵢ` almost everywhere on each `Ωᵢ`. In particular any
two `Uᵢ`, `Uⱼ` agree almost everywhere on `Ωᵢ ∩ Ωⱼ`. The index set is arbitrary. Route: `E` is
second countable, so countably many `Ωᵢ` cover `Ω`. Define `U` on `Ω_{i_k} ∖ ⋃_{j<k} Ω_{i_j}` as
`U_{i_k}`; it agrees with every `Uᵢ` almost everywhere on `Ωᵢ` by uniqueness. A test function
on `Ω` splits, by a smooth partition of unity subordinate to finitely many `Ωᵢ` near its
support, into test functions of single `Ωᵢ`. Local `Lᵖ` glues by §1.1.

**Checks.**

- `u = sign(x₁)` on `ℝ²` is locally constant on the half-planes `{x₁ > 0}` and `{x₁ < 0}`, so it
  is in every class there with `Du = 0`. These two sets do not cover `ℝ²`, and `u` has a jump
  across `{x₁ = 0}`, so `u ∉ W^{1,1}_loc(ℝ²)`. A gluing statement for covers up to a null set
  would wrongly accept it, since the line is null.
- `log |x|` lies in `W^{1,p}_loc(ℝ² ∖ {0})` for every `p` and in `W^{1,p}_loc(B(0, 1))` only for
  `p < 2`. For the cover `{ℝ² ∖ {0}, B(0, 1)}` of `ℝ²`, the theorem gives membership on `ℝ²`
  exactly for `p < 2`, agreeing with §1.2.
- The empty index set: `Ω = ∅`, and both sides hold.
*Needs:* §1.1, §1.2; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.hasWeakFDerivOn_iff_forall_isCompact_closure`,
`TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn.ae_eq`, `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn.congr_ae_deriv`; Mathlib
`SmoothPartitionOfUnity.exists_isSubordinate`.

### 1.4 Agreement with Tau Ceti's `W1p`

Let `E` be an inner product space and `F = ℝ`. Prove that `u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; ℝ)` iff, for every
open `V` with compact closure contained in `Ω`, some `w ∈ TauCeti.W1p μ V p` has value equal to
`u` almost everywhere on `V` (Mazya2011 §1.1). Then `Du(x) = ⟨∇w(x), ·⟩` almost everywhere on
`V` (`TauCeti.mem_w1pSubmodule_iff_hasWeakFDerivOn`). This is GeometricCurrents G6's
`W^{1,p}_loc(Ω)` at order one. Route: "only if" restricts local `Lᵖ` to `V`, whose closure is a
compact subset of `Ω`; "if" glues the derivatives of the `w` over an exhaustion by §1.3.

**Checks.**

- `E = ℝ²`, `u(x) = x₁`, `V = B(0, 1/2)`: the restriction is an element of `TauCeti.W1p μ V p`
  with gradient `e₁`, and `Du = ⟨e₁, ·⟩`.
- `u = log |x|` on `Ω = ℝ²`, `p = 2`: on `V = B(0, 1/2)` no element of `TauCeti.W1p μ V 2` has
  value `u`, since `∫_V |x|^{−2} dx = ∞`. This agrees with §1.2's second Check.
- `p = ∞`, `u = |x|` on `ℝ`: on every bounded `V` the restriction lies in
  `TauCeti.W1p μ V ∞` with gradient `sign(x)`. On `V = ℝ`, which is not relatively compact, it
  does not, since `|x| ∉ L^∞(ℝ)`.

*Needs:* §1.2, §1.3; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.W1p`, `TauCeti.mem_w1pSubmodule_iff_hasWeakFDerivOn`.

### Examples

- `|x|` on `ℝⁿ` lies in `W^{1,∞}_loc(ℝⁿ)`, with `Du(x)v = ⟨x, v⟩/|x|` for `x ≠ 0`.
- `x ↦ x/|x|` on `ℝ³ ∖ {0}` is smooth, hence in every class there. On `ℝ³` it lies in
  `W^{1,p}_loc(ℝ³; ℝ³)` exactly for `p < 3`, since `|Du(x)|_HS = √2/|x|`.

## Layer 2: chain rules on Euclidean domains

### 2.1 Null sets under `C¹` maps

Let `μ`, `μ'` be additive Haar measures on `E`, `E'`, and `Ω' ⊆ E'` open. Prove (Lee2012 Ch. 6):

- If `θ : E' → E` is differentiable on a set `A` with `μ'(A) = 0` and `finrank E' ≤ finrank E`,
  then `μ(θ(A)) = 0`. Route: for equal dimensions, through a linear equivalence and
  `MeasureTheory.addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_differentiableOn_of_addHaar_eq_zero`; for smaller
  dimension, `DifferentiableOn.addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_finrank_lt_finrank`.
- If `θ` is `C¹` on `Ω'` and `fderiv θ y` is invertible for every `y ∈ Ω'`, then
  `μ'(Ω' ∩ θ⁻¹(S)) = 0` for every `μ`-null `S ⊆ E`. Route: by the inverse function theorem
  (`ContDiffAt.toOpenPartialHomeomorph`) countably many open sets on which `θ` has a `C¹`
  inverse cover `Ω'`, and the first item applies to those inverses.

**Checks.**

- The projection `(x, y) ↦ x` from `ℝ²` to `ℝ` maps the null set `ℝ × {0}` onto `ℝ`, which is
  not null. Here `finrank E' = 2 > 1`, so the dimension hypothesis is used.
- A constant map `ℝ² → ℝ²` has `θ⁻¹({c}) = ℝ²`. The derivative `0` is not invertible, so the
  invertibility hypothesis is used.
- The Cantor function maps the Cantor set, which is null, onto `[0, 1]`, of measure `1`. It is
  not differentiable on the Cantor set, so differentiability on `A` is used.

*Needs:* Mathlib `MeasureTheory.addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_differentiableOn_of_addHaar_eq_zero`,
`ContDiffAt.toOpenPartialHomeomorph`; Tau Ceti
`DifferentiableOn.addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_finrank_lt_finrank`.

### 2.2 Precomposition with `C¹` local diffeomorphisms (T1(a))

Let `Ω ⊆ E` and `Ω' ⊆ E'` be open. Let `θ : E' → E` be `C¹` on `Ω'`, with `θ(Ω') ⊆ Ω` and
`fderiv θ y` invertible for every `y ∈ Ω'`. Prove (Ziemer1989 Theorem 2.2.2; Mazya2011 §1.1):

- if `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn μ Ω u U`, then
  `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn μ' Ω' (u ∘ θ) (y ↦ U(θ y) ∘ fderiv θ y)`;
- if `u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; F)` with `1 ≤ p ≤ ∞`, then `u ∘ θ ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(Ω'; F)`, and
  `D(u ∘ θ)(y) = Du(θ y) ∘ Dθ(y)` for almost every `y ∈ Ω'`.

No bound on `Dθ` or `(Dθ)⁻¹` and no injectivity is assumed. `C¹` diffeomorphisms `Ω' → Ω`,
`C¹` open embeddings and `C¹` coverings are special cases.

Route. Linear equivalences of `E` and `E'` with `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` carry Haar measures to
Haar measures. `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn.comp_measurePreserving` and the independence of the Haar
measure (§1.2) therefore reduce to `E = E' = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`. Around each `y₀ ∈ Ω'`, the
inverse function theorem gives an open `W ∋ y₀` with compact closure in `Ω'` on which `θ` is
injective. On the closure, `‖Dθ‖ ≤ L` and `|det Dθ| ≥ c > 0`. Choose an open `V` with compact
closure in `Ω` containing `θ(W)`. Each coordinate of `u` lies in `TauCeti.W1p μ V 1`, and
`TauCeti.W1p.compL` with `TauCeti.W1p.gradient_compL_ae` gives the weak derivative on `W`. Since
`⟨Dθ* ∇u(θ y), v⟩ = ∇u(θ y) · Dθ(y) v`, this is the claimed formula. §1.3 glues over the cover
`{W}`. Local `Lᵖ` follows from `‖U(θ y) ∘ Dθ(y)‖ ≤ L ‖U(θ y)‖`, from the change of variables
`MeasureTheory.lintegral_image_eq_lintegral_abs_det_fderiv_mul` on each `W` for finite `p`, and
from §2.1 for `p = ∞`, where null sets pull back to null sets.

**Checks.**

- `θ(y) = 2y` on `ℝⁿ` and `u = |x|`: the formula gives `Du(2y) ∘ 2 id = 2⟨y, ·⟩/|y|`, the
  derivative of `u ∘ θ = 2|y|`.
- `θ(z) = z²` on `ℂ ∖ {0}`, a two-to-one local diffeomorphism, and `u(w) = log |w|`, with
  `Du(w)h = ⟨w, h⟩/|w|²`: `Du(z²)(2zh) = ⟨z², 2zh⟩/|z|⁴ = 2⟨z, h⟩/|z|²`, the derivative of
  `u ∘ θ = 2 log |z|`.
- Invertibility is used: for `θ(y₁, y₂) = (y₁, 0)` on `ℝ²` and `u = log |x| ∈ W^{1,1}_loc(ℝ²)`,
  `u ∘ θ = log |y₁|` has `∂₁ = 1/y₁` and `∫_{[−1,1]²} |y₁|^{−1} dy = ∞`. Moreover `u ∘ θ` is not
  determined by the class of `u`, since the image line is null.
- The local class is used: `θ(y) = y³ + y` is a `C^∞` diffeomorphism of `ℝ` with `θ' ≥ 1`, and
  `u = |x| ∈ W^{1,∞}_loc(ℝ)`. Then `D(u ∘ θ)(y) = (3y² + 1) sign(y)` is in `L^∞_loc(ℝ)` but not
  in `L^∞(ℝ)`, so no global bounded statement applies.
- For `E' = E` an inner product space, `p < ∞`, `θ` injective on `Ω'` with `‖Dθ‖ ≤ L` and
  `|det Dθ| ≥ c > 0`, and `F = ℝ`, the derivative agrees with `TauCeti.W1p.gradient_compL_ae`.
- For `E = E' = ℂ`, `p > 2` and `θ` a `C¹` diffeomorphism of `Ω'` onto `Ω`, the second item is
  PseudoholomorphicCurveAnalysis PH1.2's change of variables at `k = 1`. The covering `z ↦ z²`
  of the second Check, and every `1 ≤ p ≤ 2`, lie outside that statement.

### 2.3 Postcomposition with `C¹` maps of bounded derivative

Let `G : F → F'` be `C¹` on `F` with `‖DG(v)‖ ≤ L` for every `v`. Prove (Ziemer1989
Theorem 2.1.11, whose scalar statement this extends to vector values):

- if `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn μ Ω u U`, then
  `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn μ Ω (G ∘ u) (x ↦ DG(u x) ∘ U x)`;
- if `u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; F)`, then `G ∘ u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; F')`, with
  `D(G ∘ u) = DG(u) ∘ Du` almost everywhere.

`u` need not be continuous. Route: on an open `V` with compact closure in `Ω`, mollify the zero
extension of `u` from a slightly larger set. The mollifications `u_ε` are differentiable on `V`
with derivative the mollified `U`
(`TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn.hasFDerivAt_indicator_convolution_normed`), and `u_ε → u`,
`Du_ε → U` in `L¹(V)` (`TauCeti.tendsto_eLpNorm_normed_convolution_sub`), almost everywhere along
a sequence. Then `G ∘ u_ε → G ∘ u` in `L¹(V)` because `G` is `L`-Lipschitz, and
`DG(u_ε) Du_ε → DG(u) U` in `L¹(V)` by dominated convergence with bound `2L|U|`. Conclude with
`TauCeti.hasWeakFDerivOn_of_tendsto_lintegral_enorm_sub` and
`TauCeti.hasWeakFDerivOn_iff_forall_isCompact_closure`. The bounds
`|G(u)| ≤ |G(0)| + L|u|` and `‖DG(u) Du‖ ≤ L ‖Du‖` give local `Lᵖ`.

**Checks.**

- For `F = F' = ℝ`, `p < ∞` and `u ∈ TauCeti.W1p μ Ω p`, the derivative is the one of
  `TauCeti.W1p.hasWeakFDerivOn_comp`, `G'(u) ∇u` read through the inner product.
- For linear `G = A`, the statement is §1.2's `D(A ∘ u) = A ∘ Du`.
- Bounded derivative is used: `G(t) = e^{t²}` and `u = log |x| ∈ W^{1,1}_loc(ℝ²)`. Then
  `G(u(x)) = e^{(log |x|)²} ≥ |x|^{−2}` when `|x| ≤ e^{−2}`, and
  `∫_{|x|<e^{−2}} |x|^{−2} dx = ∞`, so `G ∘ u ∉ L¹_loc(ℝ²)`.

### 2.4 Postcomposition of continuous maps with `C¹` maps (T1(b))

Let `W ⊆ F` be open and `G : F → F'` be `C¹` on `W`. Let `u` be continuous on `Ω` with
`u(Ω) ⊆ W`. Prove (Ziemer1989 Theorem 2.1.11; Mazya2011 §1.1):

- if `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn μ Ω u U`, then
  `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn μ Ω (G ∘ u) (x ↦ DG(u x) ∘ U x)`;
- if `u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; F)`, then `G ∘ u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; F')` with
  `D(G ∘ u) = DG(u) ∘ Du` almost everywhere.

No bound on `DG` is assumed. Route: on an open `V` with compact closure in `Ω`, `K = u(V̄)` is a
compact subset of `W`. A smooth cut-off equal to `1` on a closed neighbourhood of `K` whose
support has compact closure in `W` (`exists_contDiff_support_eq_eq_one_iff`) turns `G` into a
compactly supported `C¹` map `G̃ : F → F'`
that equals `G` near `K`. Apply §2.3 to `G̃` on `V`, and glue by §1.3. Local `Lᵖ` holds because
`DG ∘ u` is bounded on compact subsets of `Ω`.

**Checks.**

- *Leibniz rule.* `G(s, t) = st` on `F = ℝ²` and `u = (u₁, u₂)` continuous:
  `D(u₁u₂) = u₂ Du₁ + u₁ Du₂`.
- `G = log` on `W = (0, ∞)` and `u = |x|` on `Ω = ℝ² ∖ {0}`: `G ∘ u = log |x|` lies in every
  class on `ℝ² ∖ {0}`, with `D(G ∘ u)(x) = ⟨x, ·⟩/|x|²`. On `Ω = ℝ²` the hypothesis
  `u(Ω) ⊆ W` fails at `0`, and indeed `log |x| ∉ W^{1,2}_loc(ℝ²)`.
- Continuity is used: §2.3's third Check has `u = log |x|` discontinuous at `0` and
  `G(t) = e^{t²}` smooth on `W = ℝ`, with `G ∘ u ∉ L¹_loc`.
- For `E = ℂ`, `p > 2` and `W = F`, a member `u` has a continuous representative (PH1.2's Morrey
  embedding), and the second item for it is PseudoholomorphicCurveAnalysis PH1.2's composition
  at `k = 1`. The second Check, `G = log` on `W = (0, ∞)`, needs `G` only on `W` and lies outside
  that statement.

*Needs:* §1.3, §2.3; Mathlib `exists_contDiff_support_eq_eq_one_iff`.

### Examples

- `u ↦ |u|²` and `u ↦ ⟨u, v⟩` on continuous members, with `D|u|² = 2⟨u, Du⟩`.
- Polar coordinates: for `u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(ℝ² ∖ {0})`, the composition with
  `(r, t) ↦ (r cos t, r sin t)` on `(0, ∞) × ℝ` is a member, by §2.2 with a non-injective local
  diffeomorphism.

inverse function theorem, Jacobian change of variables and bump functions.

## Layer 3: null sets and local integrability on manifolds

### 3.1 Chartwise null sets are Riemannian null sets

Let `M` carry `[IsManifold I 1 M]`, `[LindelofSpace M]`, `[MeasurableSpace M] [BorelSpace M]` and
a continuous Riemannian metric. The model may have boundary in this section. Prove that for
every set `s ⊆ M`, `TauCeti.IsNullSet I s` iff `TauCeti.riemannianVolume s = 0` (Lee2012 Ch. 6 and
Ch. 16). Measurability of `s` is not assumed; the volume is the outer measure.

Route. By `TauCeti.riemannianVolume_restrict_source`, on a preferred chart source the volume is
`TauCeti.chartRiemannianVolume`. That is the comap along the chart of
`(Module.finBasis ℝ E).addHaar` weighted by `TauCeti.chartVolumeDensity`. The comap evaluates
arbitrary sets through their images (`MeasurableEmbedding.comap_apply`), a weighted Haar
measure has the null sets of the Haar measure where the weight is positive
(`TauCeti.chartVolumeDensity_pos`), and countably many chart sources cover `M`.

Consequences:

- `∀ᵐ x ∂riemannianVolume, P x` iff `{x | ¬ P x}` is a `TauCeti.IsNullSet`. So any two continuous
  metrics on `M` have the same null sets, and "almost everywhere on `M`" has one meaning.
- On a finite-dimensional real inner product space `E` with its flat metric,
  `TauCeti.riemannianVolume = volume`. The chart is the identity, the density is the constant
  `√det` of the Gram matrix of `Module.finBasis ℝ E`, and that constant times
  `(Module.finBasis ℝ E).addHaar` is `volume` (`Module.Basis.addHaar_eq_iff`).

**Checks.**

- Dimension `0`: the Haar measures of the zero space give mass to `{0}`, so the only chartwise
  null set is `∅`. The Riemannian volume is counting measure (the `0 × 0` Gram determinant is
  `1`), whose only null set is `∅`.
- On `ℝ²`, the unit square has volume `1` for the flat metric and `4` for `4(dx² + dy²)` (the
  density is `√det(4 I₂) = 4`), while a segment is null for both.
- No non-empty open set is null on either side. That is `TauCeti.IsNullSet.interior_eq_empty`
  and `TauCeti.isOpenPosMeasure_riemannianVolume`, which therefore agree.
- For a smooth metric on a smooth, boundaryless, Hausdorff, second-countable manifold, the
  statement is RiemannianGeometry R4.6's comparison of chartwise nullity with the Riemannian
  volume. The continuous metric `(1 + |x₁|^{1/2})(dx₁² + dx₂²)` on `ℝ²` is not differentiable
  along `x₁ = 0`, so it lies outside R4.6 and inside §3.1. Its volume has density
  `1 + |x₁|^{1/2}` against Lebesgue measure, the unit square `[0, 1]²` has volume
  `∫_0^1 (1 + t^{1/2}) dt = 5/3`, and the segment `{0} × [0, 1]`, along which the metric is not
  differentiable, is null for it as for the flat metric. A comparison stated only for smooth
  metrics would say nothing here.

*Needs:* Tau Ceti `TauCeti.IsNullSet`, `TauCeti.IsNullSet.iUnion`, `TauCeti.riemannianVolume`,
`TauCeti.riemannianVolume_restrict_source`, `TauCeti.chartRiemannianVolume`,

`MeasurableEmbedding.comap_apply`, `MeasureTheory.withDensity_absolutelyContinuous`,
`Module.Basis.addHaar_eq_iff`.

### 3.2 Local Lebesgue classes on manifolds

With `M` as in §3.1 and boundaryless, prove the following for `g : M → B`, `B` a normed group,
and `1 ≤ p ≤ ∞`:
`g ∈ L^p_loc(M, riemannianVolume)` (§1.1 with `s = M`) iff
`g ∘ (extChartAt I x₀).symm ∈ L^p_loc((extChartAt I x₀).target, μ)` for every `x₀ ∈ M` and one,
equivalently every, Haar measure `μ` on `E` (Lee2012 Ch. 16). The same holds with the charts of
any atlas in `IsManifold.maximalAtlas`. Route: on a compact subset of a chart source, the chart
density is bounded above and below by positive constants. The comparable-measures criterion of
§1.1 then applies, and §1.1's gluing covers compact subsets of `M`.

- Any two continuous metrics on `M` give the same class `L^p_loc(M)`.
- The class is local: membership on each set of an open cover gives membership on `M`.

**Checks.**

- On `M = ℝ`, the metrics `dx²` and `e^{2x} dx²` give the same local classes but different
  global ones: `g = 1_{[0,∞)} e^{−x}` has `∫ g dx = 1` and `∫ g e^{x} dx = ∞`.
- On `M = (0, ∞)`, `g(x) = 1/x` lies in `L^∞_loc(M)`, as in §1.1.
- On a `0`-manifold every function is in every local class, since compact sets are finite and
  the volume is counting measure.

*Needs:* §1.1, §3.1; Mathlib `isOpen_extChartAt_target`, `contDiffOn_ext_coord_change`,
`ModelWithCorners.contDiffOn_extendCoordChange`; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.chartVolumeDensity_changeChart`,
`TauCeti.setLIntegral_riemannianVolume_of_subset`.

### 3.3 Null sets under `C¹` maps of manifolds

Let `M'` and `M` be boundaryless `C¹` manifolds with models `E'`, `E`. Prove (Lee2012 Ch. 6):

- if `θ : M' → M` is a `C¹` local diffeomorphism (`IsLocalDiffeomorph I' I 1 θ`), then
  `θ⁻¹(s)` is a `TauCeti.IsNullSet` whenever `s` is;
- if `f : M' → M` is `C¹`, `finrank E' ≤ finrank E`, and `s ⊆ M'` is a `TauCeti.IsNullSet`
  contained in the union of countably many preferred chart sources `(extChartAt I' xₖ).source`,
  then `f(s)` is a `TauCeti.IsNullSet`. Every `s` has such a cover when `[LindelofSpace M']`,
  since the preferred chart sources form an open cover of `M'`;
- for an open `U ⊆ M` and `s ⊆ U`, `s` is null in the manifold `U` iff it is null in `M`.

Route: read in charts, with §2.1 and `contDiffOn_ext_coord_change`. For the first and third
items, a chart source of the domain is second countable, so countably many open sets on which `θ`
has a `C¹` inverse (first item), or countably many chart sources of `U` (third item), cover it,
and no countability of `M'` or `M` is used.
For the second item, `f(s) = ⋃ₖ f(s ∩ Sₖ)` over the countable cover `(Sₖ)`. In a chart `ψ` of
`M`, `ψ(f(s ∩ Sₖ) ∩ ψ.source)` is the image of the null set
`φₖ(s ∩ Sₖ ∩ f⁻¹(ψ.source))` under the representative `ψ ∘ f ∘ φₖ.symm`, which is differentiable
on the open set `φₖ(Sₖ ∩ f⁻¹(ψ.source))`. That image is null by §2.1, and
`TauCeti.IsNullSet.iUnion` takes the countable union.

**Checks.**

- The covering `t ↦ e^{it}` of the circle by `ℝ` pulls a point back to a translate of `2πℤ`,
  which is countable and null.
- The `C¹` map `(x, y) ↦ (x, 0)` of `ℝ²` is not a local diffeomorphism, and it pulls the null
  line `ℝ × {0}` back to `ℝ²`.
- The projection `ℝ² → ℝ` maps the null line `ℝ × {0}` onto `ℝ`, which is not null. The
  dimension hypothesis of the second item is used.
- The countable cover of the second item is used. Let `D` be `ℝ` with the discrete topology and
  `M' = ℝ × D`, charted by `(x, d) ↦ x` on each slice `ℝ × {d}`: a Hausdorff `C^∞` `1`-manifold
  that is not Lindelöf. The locally constant map `f(x, d) = d` into `ℝ` is `C¹`. The set
  `s = {0} × D` meets each chart source in one point, whose image `{0}` is null, so `s` is
  null; but `f(s) = ℝ` is not. Here `s` meets uncountably many slices, and no countable family
  of chart sources covers it. With `D = ℤ` instead, `M'` is Lindelöf and `f(s) = ℤ` is null.

*Needs:* §2.1; Mathlib `IsLocalDiffeomorph`, `contDiffOn_ext_coord_change`; Tau Ceti
`TauCeti.IsNullSet`, `TauCeti.IsNullSet.iUnion`.

### Examples

- On the round sphere `S²`, a great circle is null and the volume of the upper hemisphere is
  `2π`. Both statements are independent of the chart used to check nullity.

### Dependencies

Tau Ceti's chartwise null sets, Riemannian volume and chart densities; §1.1; §2.1 for §3.3.

## Layer 4: Sobolev classes on manifolds and the weak differential

Throughout, `M` and `N` are as in the Conventions, `1 ≤ p ≤ ∞`, `φ = extChartAt I x₀` and
`ψ = extChartAt J y₀`.

### 4.1 Vector-valued Sobolev functions on a manifold

For `u : M → V`, say `u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M; V)` when `u ∘ φ.symm ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(φ.target; V)` for every
`x₀ ∈ M`. Here `φ.target` is open because `I` is boundaryless. A field
`D : (x : M) → (T_xM →L[ℝ] V)` is a *weak differential* of `u` when, for every `x₀` and every
Haar measure `μ` on `E`, `z ↦ D(φ.symm z) ∘ d(φ.symm)_z` is a weak derivative of `u ∘ φ.symm` on
`φ.target` (`TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn`). Continuity of `u` is not required. This class carries the
extrinsic description of Layer 8 (Hajlasz2009 line 28).

- *Charts.* Membership and weak differentials can be tested in the charts of any atlas contained
  in `IsManifold.maximalAtlas`. Coordinate changes are `C¹` diffeomorphisms of open sets, and
  §2.2 with §1.3 applies.
- *Existence and uniqueness.* If `M` is Lindelöf and `u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M; V)`, then `u` has a weak
  differential. Two weak differentials agree outside a `TauCeti.IsNullSet`. Changing a weak
  differential on a null set gives a weak differential. A total choice of weak differential,
  `0` off the class, is part of the API. Route: glue the chart derivatives over a countable
  cover of `M` by chart sources, as in §1.3.
- *Algebra.* The class is closed under sums, scalar multiples and continuous linear maps
  `A : V → V'`, with `D(A ∘ u) = A ∘ Du`. It is unchanged by modifying `u` on a null set.
- *`C¹` functions.* A `C¹` function lies in the class for every `p`, with weak differential
  `mfderiv u` (the tangent spaces of `V` are `V`).
- *Locality.* Restriction to an open `U ⊆ M` preserves membership. Membership on every set of an
  open cover gives membership on `M` (§1.3).
- *Composition.* If `θ : M' → M` is a `C¹` local diffeomorphism, then
  `u ∘ θ ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M'; V)` with `D(u ∘ θ)(y) = Du(θ y) ∘ dθ_y` almost everywhere (§2.2,
  §3.3). If `G : V → V'` is `C¹` with bounded derivative, then `G ∘ u` is a member with
  `D(G ∘ u) = DG(u) ∘ Du` almost everywhere (§2.3). The same holds for `G` that is `C¹` on an
  open set containing `u(M)` when `u` is continuous (§2.4).

**Checks.**

- `M = ℝ` and `u = |x|`: `u ∈ W^{1,∞}_loc(ℝ; ℝ)` with `Du = sign(x)` almost everywhere.
- The class depends on the `C¹` structure, not only on the topology. On `ℝ` with the atlas
  `{x ↦ x³}`, which is a different smooth structure, `|x|` read in that chart is `|y|^{1/3}` with
  derivative `|y|^{−2/3}/3`. That lies in `L^p_loc` iff `2p/3 < 1`, so `|x|` is in the class of
  that structure iff `p < 3/2`.
- Discontinuous members: `sign(x₁)` lies in every class on the open submanifold
  `ℝ² ∖ {x₁ = 0}`, with `Du = 0`, and in none on `ℝ²` (§1.3).
- A `0`-manifold: every `u` is a member, and its weak differential is `0`.

*Needs:* §1.2, §1.3, §2.2, §2.3, §2.4, §3.3; Mathlib `extChartAt`, `isOpen_extChartAt_target`,
`contDiffOn_ext_coord_change`, `ModelWithCorners.contDiffOn_extendCoordChange`,
`IsManifold.maximalAtlas`, `mfderiv_eq_fderiv`; Tau Ceti
`TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn`, `TauCeti.IsNullSet.iUnion`.

### 4.2 Local representatives and the class `W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` (T2)

For `f : M → N`, `x₀ ∈ M` and `y₀ ∈ N`, the *local representative* is `ψ ∘ f ∘ φ.symm : E → F`. It
lives on `Ω_{x₀y₀}(f) = φ.target ∩ φ.symm⁻¹(f⁻¹(ψ.source))`. A map `f` lies in
`W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` when `f` is continuous and every local representative lies in
`W^{1,p}_loc(Ω_{x₀y₀}(f); F)` (HeikkilaPankka2025 lines 22–23).

Prove the independence of the atlases (T2, first half). Let `𝒜 ⊆ IsManifold.maximalAtlas I 1 M`
and `ℬ ⊆ IsManifold.maximalAtlas J 1 N` cover `M` and `N`. For continuous `f`, the following are
equivalent:

- for every `e ∈ 𝒜` and `e' ∈ ℬ`, the representative `e'.extend J ∘ f ∘ (e.extend I).symm` lies in
  `W^{1,p}_loc` on `(e.extend I)(e.source ∩ f⁻¹(e'.source))`;
- `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)`;
- the first item holds for all charts of both maximal atlases.

Route: on overlaps two representatives differ by a coordinate change of `E` on the right and of
`F` on the left. Both are `C¹` (`ModelWithCorners.contDiffOn_extendCoordChange`), the first with
invertible derivative. Representatives are continuous, so §2.2 and §2.4 apply, and §1.3 glues.

- Every `Ω_{x₀y₀}(f)` is open, by continuity of `f` and openness of chart targets.
- The class involves no metric and no orientation. A copy `TauCeti.WithMetric g' M` has the same
  charts, so the same maps lie in the class.
- `W^{1,q}_loc(M, N) ⊆ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` for `p ≤ q`. Constant maps are members.
- For a vector space target `N = V` with its single chart, `W^{1,p}_loc(M, V)` is the set of
  continuous members of `W^{1,p}_loc(M; V)` (§4.1).

**Checks.**

- Continuity is part of the definition. `log |x|` lies in `W^{1,1}_loc(ℝ²; ℝ)` (§4.1) but not in
  `W^{1,1}_loc(ℝ², ℝ)`. Without continuity the sets `Ω_{x₀y₀}(f)` need not be open.
- The circle `S¹ ⊆ ℝ²` with angle charts (members of the maximal atlas) and
  `f(t) = (cos |t|^{1/2}, sin |t|^{1/2})` from `ℝ`. In an angle chart the representative is
  `|t|^{1/2}`, with derivative `sign(t)|t|^{−1/2}/2`, in `L^p_loc` iff `p < 2`. So
  `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(ℝ, S¹)` iff `p < 2`. A definition requiring global `W^{1,p}` of the
  representatives would also fail for the identity of `ℝ`.
- With the atlas `{x ↦ x³}` on the source `ℝ` and the standard target, `id` lies in the class iff
  `p < 3/2` (§4.1's second Check). Only charts of one `C¹` atlas are compared.

*Needs:* §1.2, §1.3, §2.2, §2.4, §4.1; Mathlib `extChartAt`, `isOpen_extChartAt_target`,
`contDiffOn_ext_coord_change`, `ModelWithCorners.contDiffOn_extendCoordChange`,
`IsManifold.maximalAtlas`; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.WithMetric`.

### 4.3 The weak differential (T2)

A field `D : (x : M) → (T_xM →L[ℝ] T_{f(x)}N)` is a *weak differential* of `f` when `f` is
continuous and, for every `x₀`, `y₀` and Haar measure `μ`, the field
`z ↦ dψ_{f(φ.symm z)} ∘ D(φ.symm z) ∘ d(φ.symm)_z` is a weak derivative of `ψ ∘ f ∘ φ.symm` on
`Ω_{x₀y₀}(f)`. Prove (HeikkilaPankka2025 lines 22–26):

- if `M` is Lindelöf and `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)`, a weak differential exists;
- two weak differentials agree outside a `TauCeti.IsNullSet`, and a field that agrees with a weak
  differential outside a null set is one;
- the chart formula `dψ ∘ Df ∘ (dφ)⁻¹ = D(ψ ∘ f ∘ φ⁻¹) ∘ φ` holds almost everywhere on
  `φ.source ∩ f⁻¹(ψ.source)` for all charts `φ`, `ψ` of the maximal atlases, and the chart
  expressions are a.e.-strongly measurable and locally `Lᵖ`.

The *weak differential* `Df` is a total choice: a weak differential when one exists, and `0`
otherwise. For `N = V` it is the weak differential of §4.1.

Route: as in §4.1, glue the chart derivatives over a countable cover of `M` by sets
`φₖ.source ∩ f⁻¹(ψⱼ.source)`. On overlaps, and for charts of the maximal atlases, two chart
derivatives differ by the derivatives of the coordinate changes, which are `C¹`
(`contDiffOn_ext_coord_change`, `ModelWithCorners.contDiffOn_extendCoordChange`). §2.2 handles
the source side and §2.4 the target side, the representatives being continuous. §3.3 carries
null sets between charts, and §1.3 glues.

**Checks.**

- The direction witness of the Conventions: for `M = N = ℝ`, the chart `φ(x) = 2x` and `f = id`,
  `Df = 1`.
- `f = id_M`: `Df(x) = id` outside a null set.
- Totality: for a discontinuous `f`, `Df = 0` everywhere. For the map into `S¹` of §4.2 at
  `p < 2`, `Df(t)` is `sign(t)|t|^{−1/2}/2` times the angular unit vector for almost every `t`.
  Changing that field at `t = 1` gives another weak differential, so no value at a single point
  is determined.

*Needs:* §1.3, §2.2, §2.4, §3.3, §4.1, §4.2; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn.ae_eq`,
`TauCeti.IsNullSet.iUnion`; Mathlib `mfderiv`, `contDiffOn_ext_coord_change`,
`ModelWithCorners.contDiffOn_extendCoordChange`.

### 4.4 `C¹` maps (T2)

Prove that a `C¹` map `f : M → N` (`ContMDiff I J 1 f`) lies in `W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` for every
`1 ≤ p ≤ ∞`, that `mfderiv f` is a weak differential of `f`, and hence that `Df = mfderiv f`
outside a `TauCeti.IsNullSet` (Ziemer1989 Ch. 2 §2.1, where the classical derivative of a `C¹`
function on a Euclidean domain is its weak derivative). Route: its representatives are `C¹`,
with derivative the chart expression of `mfderiv` (`mfderiv_eq_fderiv` in charts), and §1.2
applies.

**Checks.**

- `f(t) = t|t|` on `ℝ` is `C¹` but not `C²`. `mfderiv f t = 2|t|` at every `t`, so
  `Df(t) = 2|t|` for almost every `t`, and `f` is in every class.
- `f = |t|` is not `C¹`, yet it is in every class, with `Df = sign(t)` almost everywhere. The
  theorem gives a sufficient condition only.
- The Cantor function, `C¹` with derivative `0` off the Cantor set, is in no class (§1.2), so
  "`C¹` off a closed null set" does not suffice.

*Needs:* §1.2, §4.2, §4.3; Mathlib `mfderiv_eq_fderiv`, `ContMDiff`.

### 4.5 Restriction, locality and metric copies

Prove, for continuous `f : M → N` (Mazya2011 §1.1, locality of weak derivatives):

- for an open `U ⊆ M`, `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` gives `f|_U ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(U, N)`, with
  `D(f|_U) = Df|_U` almost everywhere (open subsets carry
  `TopologicalSpace.Opens.instChartedSpace`);
- if `(Uᵢ)` is an open cover of `M` and `f|_{Uᵢ} ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(Uᵢ, N)` for every `i`, then
  `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)`;
- if `f(M) ⊆ W` for an open `W ⊆ N`, then `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` iff the corestriction lies in
  `W^{1,p}_loc(M, W)`, with the same weak differential;
- for a second continuous metric `g'` on `M` or on `N`, `f` and the same map between the
  `TauCeti.WithMetric` copies have the same membership. Their weak differentials agree outside a
  null set, since the copies have the same charts.

Route for the corestriction. The preferred chart of `W` at `y ∈ W` is the restriction of
`ψ_y = extChartAt J y` (`TopologicalSpace.Opens.instChartedSpace`), and `f(M) ⊆ W`, so the
corestriction's representatives are those of `f` at points of `W`, on the same domains. A chart
`ψ` at `y₀ ∈ N ∖ W` may still meet `f(M)`; it is read through a chart of `W`. Near a point
`φ(x)` with `f(x) = y`, the representative at `(x₀, y₀)` is
`(ψ ∘ ψ_y.symm) ∘ (ψ_y ∘ f ∘ φ.symm)`: a continuous member followed by a coordinate change that is
`C¹` on an open set containing its values (`contDiffOn_ext_coord_change`). So §2.4 gives
membership, and with the chain rule `d(ψ ∘ ψ_y.symm) ∘ dψ_y = dψ` the defining identity of the
same weak differential at `y₀`; §1.3 glues.

**Checks.**

- The map into `S¹` of §4.2 is smooth on `(0, ∞)` and on `(−∞, 0)`, hence in every class there,
  but on `ℝ` only for `p < 2`. The cover `{(0, ∞), (−∞, 0)}` misses `0`, so gluing does not
  apply.
- `sign(x₁)` on the half-planes (§1.3's first Check) shows the cover must be an open cover of
  all of `M`.
- `f = tanh` from `ℝ` to `ℝ` corestricts to `(−1, 1)` with the same `Df = 1 − tanh²`. The
  preferred chart of `ℝ` at `2 ∉ (−1, 1)` is the identity, whose source meets `tanh(ℝ)`. So
  membership in `W^{1,p}_loc(ℝ, ℝ)` also asks for the representative there, and it is the
  corestriction's representative `tanh` followed by the coordinate change `id`. A test through
  the charts of `W` alone would skip that chart.

*Needs:* §1.3, §2.4, §3.3, §4.2, §4.3; Mathlib `TopologicalSpace.Opens.instChartedSpace`,
`contDiffOn_ext_coord_change`; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.WithMetric`.

### 4.6 Chain rules on manifolds

Prove (Ziemer1989 Theorem 2.1.11, Theorem 2.2.2):

- *(a)* if `θ : M' → M` is a `C¹` local diffeomorphism (`IsLocalDiffeomorph I' I 1 θ`) and
  `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)`, then `f ∘ θ ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M', N)` and `D(f ∘ θ)(y) = Df(θ y) ∘ dθ_y`
  almost everywhere on `M'`;
- *(b)* if `g : N → P` is `C¹` (`ContMDiff J I_P 1 g`) and `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)`, then
  `g ∘ f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, P)` and `D(g ∘ f)(x) = dg_{f(x)} ∘ Df(x)` almost everywhere on `M`.

Neither needs a bound on `dθ`, `(dθ)⁻¹` or `dg`. Route: in charts by §2.2 and §2.4, with §3.3 for
the null sets in (a).

**Checks.**

- *(a)* with `θ(y) = 2y` on `ℝ` and `f(t) = |t|^{1/2}`: `D(f ∘ θ)(y) = 2 Df(2y)`, which is
  `sign(y)|2y|^{−1/2}`, the derivative of `√2 |y|^{1/2}`.
- *(b)* with `g(s) = (cos s, sin s)` from `ℝ` to `S¹` and `f(t) = |t|^{1/2}`: `g ∘ f` is the map of
  §4.2, in the class exactly for `p < 2`, the range of `f`.
- The local-diffeomorphism hypothesis of (a) is used. `θ(y₁, y₂) = (y₁, 0)` and
  `f(x) = |x|^{1/2}` on `ℝ²`: `|Df| ∼ |x|^{−1/2}` is in `L^p_loc(ℝ²)` iff `p < 4`, while
  `f ∘ θ = |y₁|^{1/2}` has `∂₁ ∼ |y₁|^{−1/2}`, in `L^p_loc(ℝ²)` iff `p < 2`. For `2 ≤ p < 4`, `f`
  is in the class and `f ∘ θ` is not.

*Needs:* §2.2, §2.4, §3.3, §4.2, §4.3; Mathlib `IsLocalDiffeomorph`, `ContMDiff`.

### Examples

- The covering `ℝ → S¹` and `f : S¹ → N`: `f` is in the class iff its periodic lift is (§4.5 and
  §4.6(a) in both directions, the covering being a local diffeomorphism with local inverses).
- Inclusions of open subsets, charts and `C¹` diffeomorphisms are in every class.

### Dependencies

Layers 1–3; Mathlib's charts, maximal atlases, `mfderiv` and local diffeomorphisms; Tau Ceti's
`TauCeti.WithMetric` and null sets.

## Layer 5: the operator norm of the differential

Throughout, `M` and `N` carry continuous Riemannian metrics, `M` is Lindelöf with
`[MeasurableSpace M] [BorelSpace M]`, and `vol_M = TauCeti.riemannianVolume`.

### 5.1 The norm `‖Df‖` and its chart comparison

For `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` consider `x ↦ ‖Df(x)‖`, the operator norm from `(T_xM, g_M)` to
`(T_{f(x)}N, g_N)` (HeikkilaPankka2025 line 26; Rickman1993 Ch. I §1). Prove:

- `x ↦ ‖Df(x)‖` is a.e.-strongly measurable for `vol_M`;
- *chart comparison:* for charts `φ`, `ψ` and a compact `K ⊆ φ.source ∩ f⁻¹(ψ.source)`, there is
  `C ≥ 1` with `C⁻¹ ‖D(ψ ∘ f ∘ φ⁻¹)(φ x)‖ ≤ ‖Df(x)‖ ≤ C ‖D(ψ ∘ f ∘ φ⁻¹)(φ x)‖` for almost every
  `x ∈ K`, the left norms being those of `E` and `F`. The metrics are continuous and the chart
  derivatives are continuous and invertible, so all four comparison factors are bounded on `K`;
- for `C¹` `f`, `‖Df‖ = ‖mfderiv f‖` almost everywhere (§4.4);
- `‖Df‖` does not depend on orientations.

**Checks.**

- `f = id` from flat `ℝ` to `ℝ` with `4 dt²` gives `‖Df‖ = 2`. A norm computed in charts with the
  norms of the models would give `1`.
- The map into `S¹` of §4.2, with the round metric of radius `1`: `‖Df(t)‖ = |t|^{−1/2}/2` for
  almost every `t`. With radius `3`: `3|t|^{−1/2}/2`.
- Chart dependence of the naive norm: in the chart `φ(x) = 2x` of the source, the representative
  of `id` has norm `1/2`, while `‖Df‖ = 1`.

*Needs:* §4.3, §4.4, §3.1; Mathlib `Bundle.RiemannianBundle`,
`IsContinuousRiemannianBundle`.

### 5.2 The `L^p` characterisation (T3)

Prove: if `f ∈ W^{1,1}_loc(M, N)` and `1 ≤ p ≤ ∞`, then `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` iff
`‖Df‖ ∈ L^p_loc(M, vol_M)` (Rickman1993 Ch. I §1; HeikkilaPankka2025 lines 22–26). Route: the
representatives are continuous, hence in every `L^p_loc`. §5.1's chart comparison and §3.2 turn
local `Lᵖ` of `‖Df‖` into local `Lᵖ` of the representatives' derivatives. Compact subsets of
`M` are covered by finitely many compact sets inside chart overlaps.

**Checks.**

- `f(t) = |t|^{1/2}` on flat `ℝ`: `f ∈ W^{1,1}_loc` and `‖Df‖ = |t|^{−1/2}/2`, in `L^p_loc` iff
  `p < 2`, which is the range of the class.
- `f(t) = t log |t|` (with `f(0) = 0`): `‖Df‖ = |log |t| + 1|` is in `L^p_loc` for every finite `p`
  and not in `L^∞_loc`. So `f` lies in `W^{1,p}_loc` for every finite `p` and not for `p = ∞`.
- The hypothesis `f ∈ W^{1,1}_loc` is used. The Cantor function has classical derivative `0`
  almost everywhere, so a pointwise "`‖Df‖ = 0 ∈ L^p_loc`" would hold, but it is in no class.

*Needs:* §3.2, §4.2, §4.3, §5.1.

### 5.3 Comparable metrics

Let `g_M`, `g'_M` be continuous metrics on `M` with `a|v| ≤ |v|' ≤ b|v|` for all tangent vectors,
`0 < a ≤ b`. Let `g_N`, `g'_N` on `N` satisfy `α|w| ≤ |w|' ≤ β|w|`, `0 < α ≤ β`. Prove that every
linear `A : T_xM → T_yN` has `(α/b)‖A‖ ≤ ‖A‖' ≤ (β/a)‖A‖`, an estimate read off the definition
of the operator norm. Hence `(α/b)‖Df‖ ≤ ‖Df‖' ≤ (β/a)‖Df‖` almost everywhere, the weak
differential being metric-free up to a null set (§4.5). Moreover any two continuous metrics are
uniformly comparable on each compact subset, so T3's condition does not depend on the metrics
(Hajlasz2009 lines 104–106, for Riemannian metrics on a compact manifold; the compactness
argument uses only continuity).

**Checks.**

- `g'_N = c² g_N`, `g'_M = g_M`: `a = b = 1`, `α = β = c`, and `‖A‖' = c‖A‖` attains both bounds.
- `ℝ²` with `g' = dx² + 4 dy²` against the flat metric on the target (`α = 1`, `β = 2`), and the
  identity from flat `ℝ²`: `‖id‖' = 2 = β/a`.
- `ℝ` with `e^{2x} dx²` on the target is not comparable to `dx²` on `ℝ`. The identity from flat
  `ℝ` has `‖id‖' = e^{x}`, unbounded on `ℝ` and bounded on compact sets.

*Needs:* §4.5, §5.1, §5.2.

### Examples

- For a smooth map between closed Riemannian manifolds, `‖Df‖` is continuous and bounded, so
  `f ∈ W^{1,∞}_loc(M, N)`.

## Layer 6: Jacobians

### 6.1 The oriented Jacobian of a linear map

Let `V`, `W` be real inner product spaces of dimension `n` with orientations
`o_V`, `o_W : Orientation ℝ · (Fin n)`. For linear `A : V → W` define the *oriented Jacobian*
`J(A)` as the unique scalar with `A^*(o_W.volumeForm) = J(A) · o_V.volumeForm`. It exists and is
unique because every alternating `n`-form on `V` is a multiple of the determinant of a basis
(`AlternatingMap.eq_smul_basis_det`) and `o_V.volumeForm` is non-zero: it takes the value `±1` on
every orthonormal basis (`Orientation.abs_volumeForm_apply_of_orthonormal`). Both facts hold for
`n = 0`, where the only basis is the empty family. This is the Jacobian
of MartioRickmanVaisala1969 line 124 and Rickman1993 Ch. I §1 when `V = W = ℝⁿ`.

- *Basis formula.* For every orthonormal basis `b : Fin n → V`,
  `J(A) = o_V.volumeForm b · o_W.volumeForm (A ∘ b)`, since `o_V.volumeForm b = ±1`. When `b` is
  positively oriented, `o_V.volumeForm b = 1` (`Orientation.volumeForm_robust`) and
  `J(A) = o_W.volumeForm (A ∘ b)`. Such a basis exists when `n ≥ 1`
  (`Orientation.finOrthonormalBasis`). It does not exist when `n = 0` and `o_V` is the negative
  orientation, since the empty basis is positively oriented (`Module.Basis.orientation_isEmpty`).
- For linear `B : W → X` with `X` oriented of dimension `n`, `J(B ∘ A) = J(B) J(A)`. Also
  `J(id_V) = 1` when `o_W = o_V` and `J(id_V) = −1` when `o_W = −o_V`, and `J(cA) = cⁿ J(A)`.
- For `V = W` with `o_V = o_W`, `J(A) = det A` (`LinearMap.det`).
- Reversing exactly one of `o_V`, `o_W` negates `J(A)`, and reversing both leaves it unchanged
  (`Orientation.volumeForm_neg_orientation`).
- `|J(A)| = normDet(A)` (`LinearMap.normDet`). So `J(A) ≠ 0` iff `A` is bijective, and `J(A) > 0`
  iff `A` is bijective and carries `o_V` to `o_W`.
- *Hadamard's inequality:* `|J(A)| ≤ ‖A‖ⁿ`, from the basis formula and
  `Orientation.abs_volumeForm_apply_le` applied to `A ∘ b` for an orthonormal basis `b`. Equality
  holds when `A` is a non-negative multiple of a linear isometry.
- For linear isometric equivalences `U : V' ≃ V` and `U' : W ≃ W'`, `J(U' ∘ A ∘ U)` is `J(A)` times
  the signs `J(U)`, `J(U') ∈ {±1}`.
- For orthonormal bases `b` of `V` and `b'` of `W`, both indexed by `Fin n`,
  `J(A) = o_V.volumeForm b · o_W.volumeForm b' · det[A]`, where `[A]` is the matrix of `A` in these
  bases and the two signs are `±1`. So `J` is a polynomial in the matrix entries, hence
  continuous. For `n = 0` the matrix is empty with determinant `1`.

**Checks.**

- `A = diag(2, 1)` on `ℝ²` with the standard orientation on both sides: `J(A) = 2 = det A`,
  `normDet(A) = 2`, and `‖A‖² = 4 ≥ 2`.
- `R = diag(−1, 1)`: `J(R) = −1` from the standard orientation to itself, and `J(R) = +1` from the
  standard orientation to its negative. The unsigned `|det R| = 1` would make `R` and the identity
  indistinguishable.
- Orthonormal bases are used. For `id : ℝ² → ℝ²` with the standard orientation on both sides,
  the matrix in the bases `(2e₁, e₂)` and `(e₁, e₂)` is `diag(2, 1)` with determinant `2`, while
  `J(id) = 1`.
- The direction of the pullback: `J(diag(2, 1)) = 2`. A definition through
  `(A⁻¹)^* vol_V = J vol_W` would give `1/2`.
- Dimension `0`: the volume form of a zero-dimensional space is `±1` on the empty family, so
  `J(A) = 1` when `o_V` and `o_W` are both positive or both negative, and `−1` otherwise.
  `normDet(A) = 1 = |J(A)|`, and Hadamard reads `1 ≤ ‖A‖⁰ = 1`. When `o_V` is negative no
  positively oriented basis exists. A definition as `o_W.volumeForm (A ∘ b)` with `b` the empty
  basis would ignore `o_V` and give `+1` for `o_V` negative and `o_W` positive.

*Needs:* Mathlib `Orientation.volumeForm`, `Orientation.volumeForm_robust`,
`Orientation.volumeForm_neg_orientation`, `Orientation.abs_volumeForm_apply_le`,
`Orientation.abs_volumeForm_apply_of_orthonormal`, `Orientation.volumeForm_map`,

### 6.2 The Jacobian of a Sobolev map (T4)

Let `M`, `N` have dimension `n`, carry continuous metrics and orientations
`o_M : TauCeti.Manifold.Orientation I M (Fin n)`, `o_N : TauCeti.Manifold.Orientation J N (Fin n)`,
and let `M` be Lindelöf with `[MeasurableSpace M] [BorelSpace M]`. For `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)`
define `J_f(x) = J(Df(x))`, computed with the tangent orientations `o_M.orientationAt x`,
`o_N.orientationAt (f x)` and the metrics (HeikkilaPankka2025 lines 25–27). Prove:

- `(Df(x))^* (vol_N)_{f(x)} = J_f(x) (vol_M)_x` for every `x`, with
  `vol = TauCeti.riemannianVolumeForm`.
  Any function `j` with `(Df)^* vol_N = j vol_M` almost everywhere equals `J_f` almost
  everywhere;
- `J_f` is a.e.-strongly measurable for `vol_M`, and `|J_f| = normDet(Df)` everywhere;
- replacing `o_M` or `o_N` by its negative negates `J_f`, and replacing both leaves it unchanged;
- *chart formula:* for preferred charts `φ` at `x₀` and `ψ` at `y₀`, for almost every
  `x ∈ φ.source ∩ f⁻¹(ψ.source)`,

      J_f(x) = ε_M(x) ε_N(f x) · det[D(ψ ∘ f ∘ φ⁻¹)(φ x)] · ρ_N(f x) / ρ_M(x).

  Here `det[·]` is the determinant of the matrix in the bases `Module.finBasis ℝ E` and
  `Module.finBasis ℝ F`, reindexed by `Fin n`, and `ρ_M`, `ρ_N` are `TauCeti.chartVolumeDensity` of
  the two charts. `ε_M(x) = ±1` according as the chart frame of `Module.finBasis ℝ E` at `x` is
  positively or negatively oriented, and likewise `ε_N`. In positively oriented charts both signs
  are `1` (Lee2012 Ch. 15);
- for `C¹` `f`, `J_f = J(mfderiv f)` almost everywhere. If `f` is orientation preserving at `x`
  (`TauCeti.Manifold.Orientation.IsOrientationPreservingAt`), then `J(mfderiv f x) > 0`.

**Checks.**

- `M = N = ℝ`, flat, standard orientations: `J_f = f'` almost everywhere. With the metric
  `4 dt²` on the target, `ρ_N = 2` and `J_f = 2f'`. A Jacobian taken as the determinant of the
  representative without densities would give `f'`, contradicting `|J_f| = normDet(Df) = 2|f'|`.
- The identity of `M` from `(M, o)` to `(M, −o)`, `M` non-empty: `J_f = −1` almost everywhere.
- The fold `F(x₁, x₂) = (|x₁|, x₂)` of `ℝ²`: `J_F = sign(x₁)` almost everywhere and `‖DF‖ = 1`. An
  unsigned Jacobian would give `1`.

*Needs:* §4.3, §4.4, §5.1, §6.1, §3.1; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.Manifold.Orientation`,
`TauCeti.Manifold.Orientation.orientationAt`, `TauCeti.Manifold.Orientation.orientationAt_neg`,
`TauCeti.Manifold.Orientation.IsOrientationPreservingAt`, `TauCeti.riemannianVolumeForm`,
`TauCeti.chartVolumeDensity`, `TauCeti.chartVolumeDensity_changeChart`.

### 6.3 Hadamard's inequality and integrability

Prove that, in the setting of §6.2, `|J_f(x)| ≤ ‖Df(x)‖ⁿ` for every `x` (Rickman1993 Ch. I §1).
Hence `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` gives `J_f ∈ L^{p/n}_loc(M, vol_M)`, with `p/n` computed in
`[0, ∞]` (`∞/n = ∞`). In particular `J_f ∈ L¹_loc(M, vol_M)` when `p ≥ n ≥ 1`, which includes
the borderline `p = n` of HeikkilaPankka2025 line 23. Route: §6.1's Hadamard inequality
pointwise, and T3.

**Checks.**

- The radial map `f(x) = x |x|^{−1/2}` of `ℝ²`: the singular values of `Df(x)` are `|x|^{−1/2}`
  (tangential) and `|x|^{−1/2}/2` (radial). So `‖Df‖ = |x|^{−1/2}` and `J_f = |x|^{−1}/2`.
  Hadamard reads `|x|^{−1}/2 ≤ |x|^{−1}`. `‖Df‖ ∈ L^p_loc` iff `p < 4`, and `J_f ∈ L^q_loc` iff
  `q < 2`, which is the bound `p/n` with `n = 2`.
- Equality: a conformal linear map `λU` has `|J| = λⁿ = ‖λU‖ⁿ`.
- For `p < n` the Jacobian need not be locally integrable. Let `f` on `ℝ²` be the sum of
  `x ↦ λ_k (x − c_k) χ(|x − c_k|/r_k)` over disjoint discs `B(c_k, r_k)` accumulating at a point,
  with `χ = 1` on `[0, 1/2]` and `0` on `[1, ∞)`, `r_k = 2^{−k}` and `λ_k = 2^k/√k`. Then `f` is
  continuous since `λ_k r_k → 0`, and `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc` for every `p < 2`, since
  `Σ λ_k^p r_k² < ∞`. Yet the inner halves of the discs contribute `π λ_k² r_k²/4 = π/(4k)` to
  `∫ J_f`, which diverges.

*Needs:* §5.2, §6.1, §6.2.

### 6.4 Jacobian measures

For `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` with `J_f ∈ L¹_loc(M, vol_M)`, define the measures
`μ_f^± = vol_M.withDensity (J_f)^±`, where `(J_f)^+ = max(J_f, 0)` and `(J_f)^− = max(−J_f, 0)`.
The *Jacobian measure* `f^* vol_N` is the signed difference: on a relatively compact Borel `A`
it is `μ_f^+(A) − μ_f^−(A) = ∫_A J_f dvol_M`, and against a bounded Borel `g` with compact support
it is `∫ g J_f dvol_M` (HeikkilaPankka2025 lines 25–27).

- `μ_f^±` are locally finite and absolutely continuous with respect to `vol_M`.
- Reversing one orientation exchanges `μ_f^+` and `μ_f^−`. If `J_f ≥ 0` almost everywhere then
  `μ_f^− = 0`.
- `μ_f^+(A) + μ_f^−(A) ≤ ∫_A ‖Df‖ⁿ dvol_M`.

Prove: let `N` also be Lindelöf with `[MeasurableSpace N] [BorelSpace N]`, so that
`vol_N = TauCeti.riemannianVolume` of `N` is defined. If `f` is a `C¹` open embedding (`C¹`,
injective, with invertible differential) and is orientation preserving at every point, then
`μ_f^− = 0` and `μ_f^+(A) = vol_N(f(A))` for every Borel `A ⊆ M`; here `f(A)` is Borel because
`f` is an open embedding (`Topology.IsOpenEmbedding.measurableEmbedding`). If `f` is orientation
reversing at every point, the roles of `μ_f^+` and `μ_f^−` are exchanged (Lee2012 Ch. 16).
Route: the chart formula of §6.2, `MeasureTheory.lintegral_image_eq_lintegral_abs_det_fderiv_mul`
in charts, `TauCeti.setLIntegral_riemannianVolume_of_subset` on `M` and on `N`, and a countable
cover.

**Checks.**

- `f(x) = 2x` on `ℝ`: `μ_f^+([0, 1]) = ∫_0^1 2 dx = 2 = vol([0, 2])`.
- `f(x) = −x` on `ℝ`: `μ_f^+ = 0` and `μ_f^−([0, 1]) = 1`. A density `|J_f|` would make the two
  maps indistinguishable.
- Injectivity is used: `f(z) = z²` on `ℂ ∖ {0}`, with `J_f = 4|z|²`, and the annulus
  `A = {1 < |z| < 2}`. Then `μ_f^+(A) = 2π ∫_1^2 4r³ dr = 30π`, while `f(A) = {1 < |w| < 4}`
  has area `15π`; the factor `2` is the multiplicity.

### Examples

- For an orientation-preserving local isometry `f`, `‖Df‖ = 1 = J_f`.
- For `f(z) = zᵏ` on `ℂ`, `J_f = k² |z|^{2k−2}` and `‖Df‖² = J_f`.

Let `E`, `F` be finite-dimensional real inner product spaces with their flat metrics, and `Ω ⊆ E`
open, a manifold through `TopologicalSpace.Opens.instChartedSpace` with the restricted metric
(`TauCeti.Manifold.instRiemannianBundleOpen`). For `f : Ω → F` choose `f̃ : E → F` with
`f = f̃ ∘ Subtype.val`. Prove (MartioRickmanVaisala1969 line 124 and lines 332–340):

- `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(Ω, F)` iff `f̃` is continuous on `Ω` and `f̃ ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(Ω; F)` for `volume`.
  Equivalently, `f̃` is continuous on `Ω` and has a weak derivative `U` on `Ω` with
  `‖U‖ ∈ L^p_loc(Ω)`;
- then `Df(x) = U(x)` for almost every `x ∈ Ω`, since the tangent spaces of `Ω` and `F` are `E`
  and `F`;
- `TauCeti.riemannianVolume` of `Ω` is `volume` restricted to `Ω`, and `‖Df(x)‖ = ‖U(x)‖`, the
  operator norm for the inner product norms, almost everywhere;
- if `F = E` has dimension `n` and an orientation `o`, and both `Ω` and `E` carry the orientation
  `TauCeti.Manifold.Orientation.model o` (restricted to `Ω` by
  `TauCeti.Manifold.Orientation.restrict`), then `J_f = det U` almost everywhere. At points where
  `f̃` is differentiable with derivative `U(x)`, this is the Jacobian `J(x, f)` of

- `f(z) = z²` on `ℂ = ℝ²` with the orientation of `(1, i)`: `J_f = 4|z|²`, which is

- The radial map of §6.3: the weak and classical derivatives agree off `0`, and `J_f = |x|^{−1}/2`.

## Layer 8: immersions, embeddings and the extrinsic class

### 8.1 Local retractions of immersions

Let `ι : N → V` be `C¹` (`ContMDiff J 𝓘(ℝ, V) 1 ι`) with `mfderiv ι y₀` injective. Prove that
there are an open `U ∋ y₀` in `N`, an open `t ⊆ V` with `ι(U) ⊆ t`, and `r : V → N` that is `C¹` on
`t` with `r(ι y) = y` for every `y ∈ U` (Lee2012 Ch. 4). No injectivity of `ι` is assumed. Route:
`ContMDiffOn.isImmersionAt_iff_injective_mfderiv` gives the immersion normal form. As in
`Manifold.IsImmersionAt.exists_contMDiffOn_retraction`, take `r` to be the inverse domain chart
after the first projection of the splitting, read in the codomain chart. Take `U` to be the
domain-chart source intersected with `ι⁻¹(t)`, in place of the embedding hypothesis there.

**Checks.**

- The inclusion of the unit circle in `ℝ²`: `r(v) = v/|v|` on `t = ℝ² ∖ {0}`.
- `ι(s) = s³` on `ℝ` is a `C^∞` homeomorphism onto `ℝ` with `ι'(0) = 0`. Every left inverse is
  `s ↦ s^{1/3}`, which is not differentiable at `0`, so the injectivity hypothesis is used.
- The figure-eight immersion of `ℝ` into `ℝ²` is not injective, yet has a local retraction on
  each patch, since `U` is a neighbourhood in the source.

### 8.2 The extrinsic description of the continuous class (T5)

Let `ι : N → V` be a `C¹` immersion (`C¹` with injective `mfderiv ι y` for every `y`) and let
`f : M → N` be continuous. Prove (Hajlasz2009 line 28; HeikkilaPankka2025 lines 1328–1329):

- `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` iff `ι ∘ f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M; V)`, and then
  `D(ι ∘ f)(x) = dι_{f(x)} ∘ Df(x)` almost everywhere;
- if `V` is an inner product space and `ι` is isometric, `⟨dι v, dι w⟩ = g_N(v, w)` for all
  tangent vectors, then `‖D(ι ∘ f)(x)‖ = ‖Df(x)‖` almost everywhere for every continuous metric on
  `M`.

Route. "Only if" is §4.6(b) with `P = V`. For "if", around `x₀` take §8.1's retraction `r` at
`f(x₀)`. By continuity `f = r ∘ (ι ∘ f)` near `x₀`, with `ι ∘ f` taking values in `t`, so §2.4
applies in charts and §4.5 glues. Isometry makes `dι` a linear isometry onto its image. Smooth
embeddings (`Manifold.IsSmoothEmbedding`), such as those of `exists_embedding_euclidean_of_compact`
for compact `N`, are the case the sources use; an isometric one is the Nash embedding of
HeikkilaPankka2025 line 1328, taken here as a hypothesis.

**Checks.**

- The unit circle in `ℝ²` and `f(t) = (cos |t|^{1/2}, sin |t|^{1/2})`:
  `|D(ι ∘ f)(t)| = |t|^{−1/2}/2 = ‖Df(t)‖`. With `2ι`, which is not isometric, the left side
  doubles.
- The immersion hypothesis is used. `ι(s) = s³` on `ℝ` and `f(t) = t^{1/3}`: `ι ∘ f = id` is
  smooth, while `Df = t^{−2/3}/3` lies in `L^p_loc` iff `p < 3/2`. So for `p ≥ 3/2`,
  `ι ∘ f` is in the class and `f` is not.
- Non-injective immersions suffice for continuous maps. With `ι` the double cover `z ↦ z²` of the
  circle into `ℝ²` and `f(t) = (cos(|t|^{1/2}/2), sin(|t|^{1/2}/2))`, `ι ∘ f` is the map of §4.2.
  Both `ι ∘ f` and `f` lie in the class exactly for `p < 2`.

*Needs:* §2.4, §4.1, §4.2, §4.3, §4.5, §4.6, §5.1, §8.1; Mathlib `Manifold.IsSmoothEmbedding`,

### 8.3 The extrinsic class of measurable maps

For a map `ι : N → V` and any `u : M → N`, say `u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M, N; ι)` when
`ι ∘ u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M; V)` (§4.1) (Hajlasz2009 lines 23–28; Bethuel1991 Introduction). No
continuity is required, so this class carries the discontinuous maps that harmonic-map theory
needs.

- Membership is unchanged by modifying `u` on a `TauCeti.IsNullSet`.
- For injective `ι` and non-empty `N`, the source's formulation agrees. A map `v : M → V` with
  `v ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M; V)` and `v(x) ∈ ι(N)` outside a null set equals `ι ∘ u` outside a null set
  for some `u` in the class, and conversely.
- For a `C¹` immersion `ι`, the continuous members are exactly `W^{1,p}_loc(M, N)` (§8.2).
- Precomposition with `C¹` local diffeomorphisms of the source preserves the class, with the chain
  rule of §4.1.

**Checks.**

- `u(x) = x/|x|` from the unit ball `B³` to `S² ⊆ ℝ³`: `|D(ι ∘ u)|_HS = √2/|x|`, and
  `∫_{B³} |x|^{−p} dx = 4π ∫_0^1 r^{2−p} dr` is finite iff `p < 3`. So `u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(B³, S²; ι)`
  for `1 ≤ p < 3`, though `u` is in the continuous class for no `p`.
- `u = sign(x₁)` from `B²` to `S⁰ = {±1} ⊆ ℝ` has a jump, so it is in no class.
- A wrong model asking only `ι ∘ u ∈ L^p_loc` would accept `sign(x₁)`.

*Needs:* §4.1, §8.2; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.IsNullSet`.

### 8.4 Independence of the embedding (T7)

Let `N` be compact and boundaryless, and `ι₁ : N → V₁`, `ι₂ : N → V₂` be `C¹` embeddings
(`Manifold.IsSmoothEmbedding J 𝓘(ℝ, Vᵢ) 1 ιᵢ`). Prove that for every `u : M → N`,
`ι₁ ∘ u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M; V₁)` iff `ι₂ ∘ u ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(M; V₂)` (Hajlasz2009 lines 23–28). For every
compactly supported `C¹` map `G : V₁ → V₂` with `G ∘ ι₁ = ι₂`, and such `G` exist,
`D(ι₂ ∘ u) = DG(ι₁ ∘ u) ∘ D(ι₁ ∘ u)` almost everywhere. So `W^{1,p}_loc(M, N; ι)` does not depend
on `ι` among `C¹` embeddings of a closed `N`.

Route: `TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding.exists_contMDiffMap_extension_hasCompactSupport`, applied to `ι₁`
bundled as a `TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding` with `g = ι₂` and the compact portion `N`, gives `G`.
`G` is `C¹` with compact support, hence of bounded derivative, and `ι₂ ∘ u = G ∘ (ι₁ ∘ u)`; §4.1's
composition with §2.3 concludes. Exchange `ι₁` and `ι₂` for the converse.

**Checks.**

- Compactness is used. Take `N = ℝ`, `ι₁ = id`, `ι₂(s) = (s, exp(exp s))`, a closed smooth
  embedding, `M = B(0, e^{−1}) ⊆ ℝ²` and `u(x) = log log(1/|x|)`. Since
  `|Du| = 1/(|x| log(1/|x|))` and `∫_0^{1/e} dr/(r log²(1/r)) < ∞`, `ι₁ ∘ u ∈ W^{1,2}_loc(M)`.
  The second coordinate of `ι₂ ∘ u` is `1/|x|`, whose gradient has size `|x|^{−2}` with
  `∫ r^{−2} r dr = ∞`, so `ι₂ ∘ u ∉ W^{1,1}_loc(M)`.
- Injectivity is used. With the double cover `z ↦ z²` of `S¹` as `ι₁` and the inclusion as `ι₂`,
  the half-angle map `u(re^{iθ}) = e^{iθ/2}` (`0 ≤ θ < 2π`) on the punctured unit disc has
  `ι₁ ∘ u = z/|z|`, which is smooth there and in every class. But `ι₂ ∘ u` jumps across the
  positive real axis and is in no class.
- Two embeddings of `S¹`: the inclusion into `ℝ²` and `z ↦ (z, z²)` into `ℝ⁴`. For
  `u(x) = x/|x|` on the unit disc both compositions have gradients of size `≍ 1/|x|`, in
  `L^p_loc` iff `p < 2`, as the theorem predicts.

*Needs:* §2.3, §4.1, §8.3; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding`,
`TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding.exists_contMDiffMap_extension_hasCompactSupport`; Mathlib
`Manifold.IsSmoothEmbedding`.

### Examples

- Maps into the round sphere `Sᵏ ⊆ ℝ^{k+1}` through the isometric inclusion:
  `‖Du‖ = |D(ι ∘ u)|` for continuous `u`, and the hedgehog `x/|x|` for discontinuous ones.

### Dependencies

Layers 2, 4 and 5; Tau Ceti's immersion normal form, retractions and compactly supported
extensions; Mathlib's smooth embeddings and the Whitney embedding.

## Downstream consumers

- **QuasiregularMaps** builds quasiregular maps on `W^{1,n}_loc(M, N)`, `Df`, `‖Df‖`, `J(A)` and
  `J_f`. Its requirements map to sections here as follows: the class to §4.2, §4.4 and §4.5; the
  weak differential and null sets to §3.1 and §4.3; the norm to §5.1–§5.3; the Jacobian to
  §6.1–§6.3; the chain rules to §3.3 and §4.6; the Euclidean case to §1.2 and §7.1. It owns the
  membership of locally Lipschitz maps (its §2.8, through Rademacher's theorem).
- **PseudoholomorphicCurveAnalysis** PH4.1: for a Riemann surface without boundary and `p > 2`,
  its class `W^{1,p}_loc(Σ, M)` is the class of §4.2, since isothermal charts are charts of the
  smooth structure (§4.2's atlas independence). The comparison is a Check of PH4.1 against §4.2.
- **SobolevMapsBetweenManifolds, Part II** starts where this roadmap stops, at the classes of
  Layers 4 and 8 without topology or approximation on them. It owns:
  - the density of smooth maps in `W^{1,p}(M, N)` for `p > dim M` (Hajlasz2009 Theorem 2.1,
    lines 129–130) and for `p = dim M` (Hajlasz2009 lines 138–141), and the topological
    obstructions for `p < dim M` (Bethuel1991);
  - traces and homotopy classes of Sobolev maps, and higher-order classes;
  - approximate differentiability and the tangency of `D(ι ∘ u)` to `ι(N)`;
  - the weak and stationary (p-)harmonic maps of Hajlasz2009 lines 37–53, which need §8.3–§8.4.

## Worked examples

- *The circle map.* `f(t) = (cos |t|^{1/2}, sin |t|^{1/2})` from flat `ℝ` to the round unit
  circle is continuous. In angle charts its representative is `|t|^{1/2}`, so
  `f ∈ W^{1,p}_loc(ℝ, S¹)` iff `p < 2` (§4.2). Its weak differential is
  `sign(t)|t|^{−1/2}/2` times the angular unit vector almost everywhere (§4.3), with
  `‖Df‖ = |t|^{−1/2}/2` almost everywhere (§5.1), in agreement with T3. The inclusion of `S¹` in
  `ℝ²` is isometric, so
  `|D(ι ∘ f)| = ‖Df‖` (§8.2). With both manifolds oriented, `J_f = Df` read as a number, since
  `n = 1`.
- *The radial stretch.* `f(x) = x|x|^{−1/2}` on `ℝ²`: `‖Df‖ = |x|^{−1/2}`, `J_f = |x|^{−1}/2`, `f`
  lies in `W^{1,p}_loc` iff `p < 4`, and `J_f ∈ L^q_loc` iff `q < 2` (§6.3). The distortion
  `‖Df‖²/J_f = 2` is constant; QuasiregularMaps calls such a map `2`-quasiregular.
- *The hedgehog.* `x/|x|` from `B³` to `S²` lies in the extrinsic class for `p < 3` (§8.3), in no
  continuous class, and the same range results from any `C¹` embedding of `S²` (§8.4).
