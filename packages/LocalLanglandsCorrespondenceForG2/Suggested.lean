# The local Langlands correspondence for G₂: target signatures

The roadmap is `README.md`; this file is not the roadmap. It states, against the pinned Mathlib and
Tau Ceti, the headline theorems of the roadmap that are statable at the pins, each with `sorry`.

Statable and stated here:

* Griess's conjugacy theorem for `G₂` (README §0.0), on the native model of `G₂(ℂ)` as the group
  of multiplicative invertible linear maps of the complex split octonions `TauCeti.Octonion ℂ`:
  two homomorphisms from a group into it whose octonion representations are completely reducible
  and isomorphic are conjugate by one automorphism;
* the unacceptability of `Spin₇(ℂ)` (README §0.8): there are two homomorphisms from a finite
  group to `Spin₇(ℂ)` that are conjugate element by element but not by one element. This is the
  reason the PGSp₆ correspondence of Layer 10 takes values in weak parameter classes.

Not statable at the pins, with what each lacks:

* the local Langlands correspondence for split `G₂` (README §7.1: a surjective finite-to-one map
  `Irr(G₂(F)) → Φ(G₂)` with the discrete, tempered and Langlands-quotient properties, the two
  theta diagrams, the two characterizations and the enhanced fibres): Tau Ceti has the local
  Weil group `W_F` of a nonarchimedean local field (`TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.WeilGroup`, with
  its degree `weilDegree`), but neither library has Weil–Deligne or `L`-parameters valued in
  `G₂(ℂ)` (continuity on `W_F`, semisimple Frobenius image, algebraicity on `SL₂(ℂ)`, with the
  automorphism group of the octonions as a linear algebraic group), the category of smooth
  representations of `G₂(F)`, or the group `G₂(F)` of a `p`-adic field as a topological group;
* the generic supercuspidal correspondence (README §7.2): the same carriers, and genericity
  (Whittaker functionals) for `G₂(F)`;
* the characterization by `G₂ × GL_r` gamma factors (README §§3.12–3.13): local gamma factors of
  smooth representations and of Weil–Deligne representations;
* standard injectivity and quadratic-twist rigidity for `G₂`-valued parameters (README
  §§0.4–0.5): the parameters above, and the embedding `G₂(ℂ) → Spin₇(ℂ)` as the stabilizer of a
  nonisotropic spinor (Mathlib has `spinGroup` and Tau Ceti has the octonions, but no comparison
  between the octonion automorphism group and `spinGroup`); their group-theoretic core is the
  Griess theorem stated here;
* Chenevier's local factorization criterion and `G₂`-valued Galois lift (README §§0.9–0.10):
  cuspidal automorphic representations of `GL₇` over a number field, their Satake parameters
  and their `ℓ`-adic Galois representations;
* the globalization theorems with a quaternion period, with Whittaker models and with
  spin-regular real weights (README §§1.4–1.7): the adelic quotients `G(k) \ G(𝔸_k)` with their
  `L²` spaces, automorphic and cuspidal representations, period and Whittaker functionals on
  them, the Fell topology on unitary duals of `p`-adic and real groups, and smooth discrete
  series of `G₂` and `PGSp₆` over local fields;
* the local and global spin transfer from generic representations of `PGSp₆` to `GL₈` through
  triality and its comparison of spin gamma factors (README §§2.2–2.5): smooth representations of
  `PGSp₆(F)`, `PGSO₈(F)` and `GL₈(F)`, the classical similitude theta correspondence, Arthur's
  correspondence for `SO₈`, the Langlands–Shahidi spin factor and the Rankin–Selberg factors;
* the Kret–Shin parameters of generic discrete series of `PGSp₆` and of discrete heart
  representations (README §§5.1–5.3, 8.2): `Spin₇`-valued Weil–Deligne parameters, automorphic
  representations of `PGSp₆` and the `GSpin₇`-valued Galois representations attached to them;
* the exceptional spin identity for generic discrete series (README §5.6) and the partial
  enhanced `PGSp₆` correspondence on diamond orbits (README §7.3): smooth representations of
  `PGSp₆(F)` and `GL₈(F)`, the classical theta correspondence and Xu's packets;
* the weak local Langlands correspondence for `PGSp₆` (README §10.1) and the description of its
  fibres as unions of Xu packets (README §10.9): the same carriers and the Spin₇-valued
  parameters of `W_F × SL₂(ℂ)`;
* the all-places global–local compatibility (README §3.15): automorphic representations of `G₂`
  over a number field and the Galois representations attached to them.

invertible `ℂ`-linear maps `g` of `TauCeti.Octonion ℂ` with `g (x * y) = g x * g y` for all `x`
and `y`. Such a map fixes the unit and preserves the trace-zero part, on which it acts by the
seven-dimensional representation `v`. -/

Theorem 1, as used in Chenevier, proof of Theorem 6.4, and Harris–Khare–Thorne, proof of
Lemma 4.6). Let `ρ, ρ' : Γ → G₂(ℂ)` be homomorphisms from a group whose octonion representations
are completely reducible. If the two representations are isomorphic, then `ρ'` is the conjugate
of `ρ` by one element of `G₂(ℂ)`. Since both representations contain the trivial line spanned by
the unit, this is the statement for the seven-dimensional representations `v ∘ ρ` and `v ∘ ρ'`. -/

Corollary 4.8). There are a finite group `Γ` and two group homomorphisms `r r' : Γ → Spin₇(ℂ)`
such that `r γ` and `r' γ` are conjugate in `Spin₇(ℂ)` for every `γ`, while no single element of
`Spin₇(ℂ)` conjugates `r` to `r'`. The source proves it for the compact form; conjugacy of
compact-valued homomorphisms under the complexification implies conjugacy under the compact form,
and element conjugacy passes from the compact form to `Spin₇(ℂ)`. -/
