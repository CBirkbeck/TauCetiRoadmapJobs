# Repair report: AdicSpacesPartIIPartII

## F01 (P2) — applied

Compound resolution request → separate generically reduced extension and countable reduced-invariant gaps, matching README contracts and plan entries. Both appear in §5.3 and Layer 5 Dependencies. Supplier Checks distinguish the reduced disjoint union from the quasi-compact embedded-nilpotent example. Evidence: ResolutionOfSingularitiesCharacteristicZero §§7.5–7.6 restrict to reduced schemes; TEMKIN12 line 99 and lines 1570–1574 supply the two mathematical inputs.

## F02 (P2) — applied

New global-dimension definition → import of AdicEtaleGeometry A2.6 and local/global comparison target. Updated Scope, Conventions, §0.2, its proof route, API, Checks and Dependencies. Computations include the product (dimension 1), empty space (⊥), and rank-two field-spectrum exclusion. Ownership: TauCetiRoadmap/AdicEtaleGeometry/README.md, A2.6, lines 7403–7454. Local dimension remains owned here.

## F03 (P3) — applied

Global formal-localization gap on §§4.1 and 4.3 → affinoid formal-model inputs alone; the global gap remains in §4.6. Replaced loose resolution and quotient contract references in §§5.3 and 6.4 with exact slugs; synchronized Layer 5 Dependencies. BH22 lines 243–252 construct the individual affinoid model; lines 339–344 require global realization only for the formal characterization.

## F04 (P3) — applied

Circular Needs edges → §4.2 explicitly consumes §4.3, which no longer consumes §4.2. Moved both transcendence-dependent API bullets from §4.4 to §4.6, preserving their hypotheses. The supply chain is §4.1 → §4.3 → §4.2 → §4.4 → §4.6. Evidence: BH22 line 235; POINEAU13 line 705 and lines 893–898.

## F05 (P3) — applied

Unsupported definition attribution → explicit local convention, with BH22 line 332 identified as a use. Moved CONRAD99 lines 653–655 to §1.4; corrected §1.8 to lines 801–805 with its algebraically closed qualification, §5.4 to HK2 line 2708, and the Layer 0 section name. Extended both manifest records and all three reference page lists; retained every source entry.

## F06 (P3) — applied

Different headline lists → Summary includes infinite-residue Gauss closure and both coordinate and group forms of subfield detection. The Lean docstring explicitly lists resolution connectedness and the G(C) form as unstatable, naming the missing carriers. No stand-in theorem or extra declaration was added. HK2 lines 2708–2713 and 2730–2734 identify the resolution and Gauss-closure applications.

## F07 (P3) — applied

Unbounded disc-radius Check → 0 < abs(c) < 1, with the positive and negative witnesses computed in §6.2. For c = p over ℚ_p, abs(c) = 1/p and abs(T) = 1 throughout the disc about 1; at radius 1, T = 0 belongs to the disc. Other polydisc-radius conventions were searched and retained their stated bounds.

## Required checks and mechanical consistency

- Elaborated packages/AdicSpacesPartIIPartII/Suggested.lean with the prescribed `lake env lean` invocation from the pinned content checkout: exit 0. Its complete diagnostics were the three expected warnings that declarations use `sorry`, at lines 49, 66 and 98. No object file was missing; no module build was needed.
- Appended `#check @name` for each of the four declarations to one scratch copy and elaborated it once successfully: exit 0, the same three warnings, and all four elaborated types. An initial scratch-generation attempt used the wrong working directory and produced no file; correcting its input path resolved that preliminary invocation. No package statement needed a binder repair.
- Compared every elaborated type against README §§3.4, 6.1 and 6.5, as recorded below. Only the module docstring changed in Suggested.lean; all four signatures and names are unchanged.
- JSON and both TOML files parse. All four gap sentences match the README verbatim. Comparing the parsed plan against its original verifies that only its top-level gaps changed; the textual diff also contains only that list.
- All four Lean declaration names occur in the README. There are no new Lean declarations, no sorry'd data and no forbidden commands. Imports remain one `import Mathlib` and the used native polydisc module. Every definition retains its API and at least three prose Checks; §0.2 has six, and the other thirteen API-bearing subsections have between three and six.
- Parsed every Layer 4 Needs line and ran a depth-first cycle check: no internal cycle. The final diff passes `git diff --check`.
- Citation resolution against indexed main 8888d45 and the 363 indexed open heads finds no unresolved cross-roadmap citations or roadmap Lean names. That tool does not check pinned library names; the pin checks below do.
- No separate gate failures were supplied in the brief. The seven findings above are all addressed. No source request is outstanding; SCHNEIDER11 and ANDRE74 retain their settled uncertified status.

| Declaration | Elaborated assumptions and conclusion compared with README | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IsUnitGaussPoint | Nontrivially normed ultrametric nonarchimedean field K, n, actual native polydisc point; every comparison equals the corresponding unit Gauss-norm comparison | All binders explicit; completeness is unnecessary for this predicate |
| gaussPoint_mem_closure_rationalPoints | Additionally complete K and infinite native residue quotient; every n and base spectrum point; existence of the specified Gauss point in the rational evaluation closure | Infinite residue and completeness retained; no loss of the base point or dimension binder |
| analytic_constantRank | Complete characteristic-zero nontrivially normed F; m,n,k and both inequalities; native analytic manifolds; analytic germ and neighbourhood rank hypothesis; centred analytic coordinates and inverses with MapsTo and the stated coordinate formula | All field, rank and manifold hypotheses retained; no global separation hypothesis introduced |
| analytic_germ_eq_zero_of_subfield | Both complete characteristic-zero nontrivially normed fields, NormedAlgebra E C, m, actual C-analytic scalar germ, eventual vanishing on E^m; eventual vanishing on C^m | Both completeness assumptions and the actual embedding retained |

The required dependency command exited 0 with exactly:

```text
moved: AdicSpacesPartIIPartII moved in the merge order from #10 to #11, right after its last supplier AdicEtaleGeometry; checked as moved (the worker moves it there when it submits)
depcheck: 51 roadmaps, 585 edges, 0 problem(s)
```

There is no UPWARD or CYCLE line. The movement is the checker's treatment of the explicit dimension supplier, despite the review's prediction of no movement. No merge-order file was edited.

## Sources, pins and ownership

All mathematical decisions and edits were made directly. Read the main-branch README shapes of RigidAnalyticGeometry, StableReduction and SchemeAndStackFoundations. Reopened the cited legal cached sources, including the full proof contexts used for the changes. No source text was copied into the package. All nine manifest keys remain, with the same access statuses and hashes. The two settled paywalled entries were not requested again.

The checked pins are Mathlib 6b7abb3c7686292736be2955bd3eb9ebf63b456a and Tau Ceti a91d3aafa8cd3e6bc33dfde0d7677ed0f1625039. Both checkout HEADs equal the revisions in the content manifest. The content snapshot matches the citation index's main revision 8888d45; the local branch label was not used as a substitute for that indexed snapshot.

| Interface checked | Exact location and conclusion |
| --- | --- |
| Native dimension | Mathlib/Topology/KrullDimension.lean:37 defines topologicalKrullDim in WithBot ℕ∞; Mathlib/RingTheory/KrullDimension/Basic.lean:26 defines ringKrullDim, and line 38 characterizes its bottom value by the zero ring. Neither definition identifies topological and coordinate-ring dimensions automatically. |
| Open-cover dimension | TauCeti/Topology/KrullDimension.lean:53, topologicalKrullDim_eq_iSup_of_isOpenEmbedding, takes open embeddings covering every point. The new route supplies exactly such an affinoid cover. |
| Global adic dimension owner | TauCetiRoadmap/AdicEtaleGeometry/README.md, A2.6, lines 7403–7454: topological dimension, the open-cover input, pure-dimension convention and classical local-ring criterion. These apply over Spa(K,K°); its rank-two K⁺ example is outside the new affinoid comparison. |
| Rigid algebra and comparisons | TauCetiRoadmap/RigidAnalyticGeometry/README.md §§1.1–1.3, 2.1–2.3, Layers 3–4, §§6.2, 7.3–7.4, 8.1–8.3 were resolved at main. Layers 3–4 begins at line 398; there are no individually numbered §§3.1–4.2. |
| Adic geometry inputs | TauCetiRoadmap/AdicSpacesPartII/README.md R0.6–R0.17 and R1.1–R1.9 were resolved at main: relative analytification is R1.2, completed classical local comparisons R1.5, properness R1.6, and the identity principle R1.9. |
| Formal and coherent inputs | TauCetiRoadmap/AdicSpacesPartIII/README.md R2.2–R2.5 and R3.1–R3.3, R3.6: formal models, specialization, Raynaud localization and coherent/proper mapping contracts. The prescribed global formal-affine realization with canonical-reduction compatibility remains an explicit supplier gap. |
| Scheme algebra | TauCetiRoadmap/SchemeAndStackFoundations/README.md §§0.3, 0.21, 4.11: relative Proj, excellent local algebra and modifications. TauCetiRoadmap/StableReduction/README.md Layer 4, lines 468–472: Rees blow-ups, their universal property and flat base change. |
| Resolution owner | ResolutionOfSingularitiesCharacteristicZero open head, §§7.1, 7.5–7.8: reduced marked resolution and regular-morphism functoriality. Read §§7.5–7.6 directly; neither states the generically reduced extension nor a countable invariant universe for the reduced functor. Both requests are now separately recorded. |
| Quotient owner | TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md Layer 3, lines 234–241: represented fppf quotients under hypotheses. It does not state smoothness of the represented torsor map. The existing quotient gap remains single and unchanged. |
| Native polydisc and evaluation | TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/AdicSpace/Spa/Polydisc/Basic.lean:72, 147, 156, 182: closedPolydisc, classicalPoint, classicalPoint_vle, classicalPoint_injective_of_isField. The carrier is a subset of the actual valuation spectrum; it is not a rigid-space category. |
| Gauss comparison | TauCeti/RingTheory/MvPowerSeries/TateAlgebra/Basic.lean:241, IsRestricted.gaussNorm_mul, retains positive polyradii and multiplicative coefficient norm. TauCeti/RingTheory/Huber/Restricted/GaussNorm.lean:80 and 87 supply restrictedMvPowerSeriesGaussEquiv and preservation of the underlying series. |
| Analytic native carriers | Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/IsManifold/Basic.lean:777 extends chart compatibility, without T2 or second-countability fields. Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Submersion.lean:171 and Immersion.lean:190 give the chart predicates used by §6.4. |
| Inversion | Mathlib/Analysis/Calculus/FDeriv/Analytic.lean:141, AnalyticAt.hasStrictFDerivAt; Mathlib/Analysis/Calculus/InverseFunctionTheorem/FDeriv.lean:117, HasStrictFDerivAt.toOpenPartialHomeomorph; Mathlib/Analysis/Analytic/Inverse.lean:656, OpenPartialHomeomorph.hasFPowerSeriesAt_symm. These supply local inversion, not constant rank. |
| Missing rigid headlines | TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/AdicSpace/PreAdicSpace/Adic.lean:243 has AdicSpace, but object searches at both pins find no rigid finite-type/smooth morphism and rational-point-atlas carriers needed for the omitted geometric headlines. No free predicate or ad hoc replacement was introduced. |

Ownership searches used the roadmaps tool over main and open heads, with narrower follow-ups where its broad result was truncated, and object searches across board packages and pinned libraries. In particular, searched dimension, normalization, components, Shilov/canonical reduction, rigid blow-ups and resolution, Gauss closure, analytic constant rank and rational-point charts. Open work was checked, including the supplied sibling index; no claim of having checked unavailable unindexed heads is made.

The comparison in §0.2 is this roadmap's extension from the supplied global dimension to its own local dimension. The generic adic dimension remains imported. TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §4.5 uses Shilov lifts for relative tropical multiplicity rather than owning this local/global rigid comparison. ReductiveGroupsPartII RG2.0.2 owns group-specific charts and Haar Jacobians; AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuliPartII B2.10 owns the real finite-Cᵏ extension, and LieGroupoidsPoisson G0.1 owns real smooth constant rank. Their exact sections were read at the indexed heads; none supplies the nonarchimedean analytic theorem here. AdmissiblePairsAndPadicHodgeStructures explicitly consumes this package's Gauss closure, weakly Shilov and resolution geometry. DiamondsAndVStacks D6.4–D6.5 and D6.9 were also reopened: its affinoid algebraic-resolution analytification remains a downstream application. No later roadmap was introduced as a supplier.

## Adversarial mathematics pass

The following are computed mathematical instances, not a claim that elaboration proves the admitted theorems. Repeated formulations of the same fact in an API, Check or worked example share its row; distinct facts have separate rows. The changed targets and all their dependent Checks are included. Here D is the unit disc, η its unit Gauss point, and π satisfies 0 < abs(π) < 1. Empty dimensions use WithBot ℕ∞, never truncated natural subtraction. Each equivalence is tested on satisfying and failing inputs.

## Maintainer consequences

ResolutionOfSingularitiesCharacteristicZero §§7.5–7.6 now has two separately tracked requests, not an asserted change to that supplier: the generically reduced extension and countable invariant labels for its reduced functor. AdicSpacesPartIII's formal-localization gap and ReductiveGroups' smooth-quotient gap are unchanged. The worker's dependency check proposes placing this package immediately after AdicEtaleGeometry.

No Lean name or section number changed, and no consumer needs a name migration. Local dimension remains the same function; every existing dimension-dependent Check in §§0.3, 1.4–1.6, 2.2–2.5 and 4.4–4.7 and the worked examples has been recomputed against the imported global convention. The title question settled outside this package in the previous review was not reopened. No commit, push, pull-request edit or change outside the authorized package files and scratch work was made.
