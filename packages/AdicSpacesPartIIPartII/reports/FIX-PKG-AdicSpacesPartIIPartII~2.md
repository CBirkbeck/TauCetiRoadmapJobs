# Repair findings and verification

## F01 (P1) — applied

The formal-localization gap names AdicSpacesPartII R1.7 → AdicSpacesPartIII R2.4–R2.5, in both README and plan. It now quantifies over an arbitrary affinoid open, with an explicit comparison of spectra. The separate supplier subsection and §§4.1, 4.3, 4.6 Needs lines name that owner. Added disc, nilpotent and non-quasi-compact Checks; corrected “above” to “below”.

## F02 (P2) — applied

Relative Proj §0.15 → §0.3; scheme blow-ups → StableReduction Layer 4, retaining SchemeAndStackFoundations §4.11 for modifications. Completion citations R1.3 → R1.5 throughout §§0.2–0.3, 0.5, 1.1–1.2, 2.1, 2.3, 5.3. Removed R1.8 from differential/Jacobian citations throughout §§0.5, 2.2, 2.5, 6.2–6.4. Added R1.6 to relative-properness dependencies in §§5.1 and 6.4.

## F03 (P2) — applied differently

Claims that DiamondsAndVStacks imports these constructions → a short potential-consumer note distinguishing its own D6.9 affinoid analytification. Scope explicitly assigns global functorial rigid resolution here. Removed the diamond Checks. Moved the double-point Check’s geometric proper-surjection assertion into §5.4; the diamond equality remains outside this package’s targets, consistently with Scope.

## F04 (P2) — applied

Compound quotient, Cartier and orbit-map gap → smoothness and surjectivity of the represented quotient morphism alone, in README and plan. ReductiveGroups Layer 3 defines the fppf quotient; its Cartier input is independently identified there. The orbit morphism remains §6.4’s target and is derived after faithfully flat extension, without assuming a rational lift.

## F05 (P2) — applied

Unqualified assertion about the affine Grassmannian → the G = G_a assertion with HK2 line 1458, Example 5.0.5, p. 32. Added the contrasting G_m lattices tⁿB_dR⁺, indexed by ℤ, as a README Check. The second erroneous occurrence disappears with F03’s downstream block; no analogous unrestricted assertion remains.

## F06 (P3) — applied differently

Normalization/flatness citations presented as a regularity theorem → an explicitly owned excellence-and-descent proof. The smooth-map route uses completed formal smoothness and localization, without a separable-residue-field assumption or coefficient-field section. Added the inseparable classical point Check. Corrected Lemma 1.1.5 to CONRAD99 line 274. André’s paper is recorded by its page locator as uncertified, not represented as read.

## F07 (P3) — applied

Proper-image citation → HK2 line 722, proof of Lemma 2.2.3; Abhyankar → POINEAU13 line 182, Notations, p. 271; connected components → CONRAD99 line 528; normalization stalks → CONRAD99 line 435. Rigid blow-ups now cite the legally fetched CONRAD06 line 1937, Definition 4.1.1 and following properties, pp. 1096–1097. TEMKIN12 remains a resolution-use citation only.

## F08 (P3) — applied

Added pinned evaluation injectivity, restricted Gauss-norm multiplicativity, the unit-weight Gauss equivalence, and Mathlib’s manifold submersion/immersion predicates to supplier contracts and relevant Needs lines. §3.3 consumes injectivity and proves the topology comparison. §3.4 consumes the multiplicative norm. §6.1 retains the rank-to-normal-form theorem: the native predicates define normal forms but do not supply that criterion.

## F09 (P3) — applied

Unconditional nonclosedness for positive-dimensional D(L) → nonclosedness when the residue field is infinite. The Check contrasts the closed subset ℤ_p in the ℚ_p disc, explains compactness-based rational separation, and computes separating neighbourhoods at η and T = √p. The computations include p = 2 and 3; §3.4’s finite-residue negative control agrees.

## F10 (P3) — applied

An unowned comparison atlas on X(F) → the atlas transported through X(F) ≅ (X^an)(F). Added potential consumers ReductiveGroupsPartII RG2.0.2 and AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuliPartII B2.10; named LieGroupoidsPoisson G0.1 as owner of real smooth constant rank. These are downstream uses, with no new supplier edge or imported prototype from either later roadmap.

## F11 (P3) — applied

“Finite-field point classes” → “finite-extension point classes” in Scope. F03’s replacement consumer note uses “finite-extension”. Removed the diamond-interpretation sentence from Suggested.lean’s module docstring: those comparisons are not this roadmap’s acceptance headlines. No declarations, binders or theorem names changed.

## F12 (P3) — not actionable in this package: maintainer naming decision

The finding explicitly leaves the title to the maintainer’s recorded naming decision. No decision is supplied. The title, folder and metadata remain unchanged; renaming a package or choosing its identity would exceed this mathematical repair. Its introduction already identifies the base as AdicSpacesPartII and describes this as its Part II extension.

## F13 (P3) — applied

Deleted every listed second Check and the same duplicate pattern in §§4.4, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5. Replaced the §4.1 declaration name by a description of power-bounded and topologically nilpotent series. A distinct dimension-zero normal-form Check replaces the repeated Frobenius Check in §6.1. No Check or API lemma was added to Suggested.lean.

## F14 (P3) — applied

RigidAnalyticGeometry’s supplier contract no longer credits it with normalization comparison or §3.2’s description of X(L). It retains its actual closed-point, reducedness, normality and component comparisons. Global normalization compatibility stays in §1.1, and finite-extension points and their classical images stay in §§3.1–3.2.

## F15 (P3) — applied

Countability presented as supplied → countability explicitly requested by gap:generically-reduced-functorial-resolution. The README and plan now require the common countable invariant set for both reduced and generically reduced functors. Thus §5.3’s non-quasi-compact reduced case no longer silently assumes an undeclared supplier assertion. Scheme resolution itself retains its existing owner.

## Evidence, ownership and source checks

Read the main-branch roadmaps ComplexTori and LocalGaloisGroups for shape. Checked ownership by object with the roadmap search tool across main and indexed open heads, and with a separate search of board packages. Read the relevant heads returned by the roadmap tool, rather than treating review quotations as instructions. No helpers were used. The pin check used content’s manifest: Mathlib 6b7abb3c7686292736be2955bd3eb9ebf63b456a and Tau Ceti a91d3aafa8cd3e6bc33dfde0d7677ed0f1625039; main was b41e47bc34e30def0db01d84cc92062ed72c6e68.

| Finding | Evidence read at its actual owner or legal source |
|---|---|
| F01 | AdicSpacesPartII R1.7 is rigid–adic comparison. AdicSpacesPartIII R2.4 is specialization; R2.5 is admissible blow-ups and Raynaud localization. BH22 line 339 through line 344 uses the precise affinoid realization and comparison of special-fibre spectra. |
| F02 | SchemeAndStackFoundations §0.3 constructs relative Proj; §0.15 is Néron–Popescu; §4.11 consumes StableReduction Layer 4’s blow-ups. StableReduction Layer 4 explicitly states the Rees construction, universal property, properness and flat base change. AdicSpacesPartII R1.5 states completion comparison, R1.6 properness, R1.8 analytic groups; R0.15–R0.17 states the needed differential and local-structure results. |
| F03 | DiamondsAndVStacks D6.9 explicitly starts with ResolutionOfSingularitiesCharacteristicZero §7.8’s algebraic affinoid modification and proves the analytic properties there. It does not claim to import this package. TEMKIN12 line 1563 supports the global functorial hypersequence theorem owned here. |
| F04 | ReductiveGroups Layer 3 defines the fppf quotient; its standing conventions and Layer 3A refer to Cartier smoothness. A represented quotient of G by H is an H-torsor by its quotient property; when H is smooth its projection is smooth locally for the fppf topology. Orbit maps follow by translation after a field extension and descent. |
| F05 | HK2 line 1458 explicitly takes G_a; HK2 line 1462 states the unique rigid analytic point. For G_m, valuation of a lattice in the rank-one B_dR module gives the integer n, with tⁿB_dR⁺ as representatives. |
| F06 | CONRAD99 line 406 states normalization compatibility; line 409 through line 417 supplies flatness, not regularity. TEMKIN12 line 1513 uses regularity without proving it. TEMKIN12 line 734 through line 745 identifies André localization and the flat/geometrically-regular-closed-fibre criterion. ANDRE74, pp. 297–307, is uncertified. No numbered theorem was guessed. |
| F07 | HK2 line 722 through line 727 is the proper-image step; POINEAU13 line 182 through line 184 states the full residue-plus-value-group inequality on printed p. 271. CONRAD99 line 528 through line 548 treats connected components; line 435 is Lemma 2.1.1. CONRAD06 line 1946 defines the proper rigid blow-up, line 1948 through line 1955 gives invertible pullback and its universal property, line 1957 through line 1960 gives flat base change and analytification. |
| F08 | TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/AdicSpace/Spa/Polydisc/Basic.lean:182, classicalPoint_injective_of_isField, includes the actual field hypothesis. TauCeti/RingTheory/MvPowerSeries/TateAlgebra/Basic.lean:241, IsRestricted.gaussNorm_mul, assumes multiplicative coefficient norm and positive polyradii. TauCeti/RingTheory/Huber/Restricted/GaussNorm.lean:80 defines the actual ring equivalence. Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Submersion.lean:171 and Immersion.lean:190 define Manifold.IsSubmersionAt and Manifold.IsImmersionAt; Submersion.lean:63 lists the missing rank criterion. |
| F09 | Direct computations below; compactness of ℤ_p supplies a finite family of rational exclusions. HK2 line 2733 uses algebraically closed residue field; our polynomial-avoidance argument uses only infinite residue field, as stated. |
| F10 | Read ReductiveGroupsPartII RG2.0.2’s characteristic-zero smooth-group-analytic-charts; AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuliPartII B2.10’s finite-Cᵏ and real-analytic extension; LieGroupoidsPoisson G0.1’s smooth constant-rank and fibre theorem. |
| F11 | HK2 line 693 requires a finite extension of the complete base field, not a finite field. |
| F12 | The review itself records an outstanding maintainer naming question; no mathematical statement forces a title. |
| F13 | Counted the resulting distinct Checks: §§0.1, 0.2, 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 5.1, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5 have respectively 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 5, 3 Checks. No affected definition falls below three. |
| F14 | RigidAnalyticGeometry §8.1 states reducedness/normality and component comparisons. CONRAD99 Theorem 2.1.3 supports this package’s normalization comparison; HK2 line 699 supports the point-class comparison. |
| F15 | ResolutionOfSingularitiesCharacteristicZero §§7.5–7.6 is the reduced marked functor. TEMKIN12 line 99 states generically reduced resolution; line 1563 through line 1571 states countable hypersequences and synchronization. Both additional requirements are now explicitly gaps rather than attributed supplier targets. |

CONRAD06 was fetched through the source service from Numdam and read at the recorded extraction. Initial author-URL and landing-page attempts failed; the subsequent legal PDF resolved that request. ANDRE74 resolved to an uncertified paywalled locator; SCHNEIDER11 retains its settled uncertified status. No source request remains outstanding, and no source text was copied into the package. Source manifests retain one key per work. All cross-roadmap citations were resolved again; ownership of global rigid gluing and functoriality stays here, while later group and Betti applications remain consumers.

## Adversarial mathematics pass

The rows cover definitions, target assertions, their API laws, conventions, changed contracts and worked examples. Equalities and equivalences were tested in both directions. The examples are mathematical computations, not Lean acceptance declarations. Unchanged APIs are grouped only when the displayed calculation tests the stated laws together; no row relies on a bare elaboration result.

| §5.3 ground-field compatibility | Cusp over K then K′/K char0 | Charts x=u²,y=u³ before and after base change; final disc becomes K′ disc | Compatibility uses regular scalar extension, not flatness alone | F06 |

## Exact validation outcomes

- Required elaboration, from the content checkout: `lake env lean <Suggested.lean>` exited 0. Diagnostics were exactly `packages/AdicSpacesPartIIPartII/Suggested.lean:45:8`, `:62:8`, and `:94:8`: `warning: declaration uses sorry`. No errors and no missing TauCeti object file; no module build was needed.
- Mechanical binder check: copied the final acceptance file to scratch and appended `#check @` for all four declarations, then elaborated once from content. Exit 0, the same three admitted-proof warnings, and all four complete types printed. `IsUnitGaussPoint` retains its field, ultrametric and nonarchimedean assumptions; the closure theorem additionally retains completeness and infinite residue field; constant rank retains completeness, characteristic zero, both rank bounds, both analytic manifold structures, local analyticity and the eventual rank condition; the subfield theorem retains both complete characteristic-zero fields and the normed-algebra embedding. These match README §§3.4, 6.1, 6.5. No binder or signature changed. An initial scratch invocation from board exited 1 with “no default toolchain configured”; rerunning from the required content checkout succeeded. No toolchain settings were changed.
- Dependency direction: the prescribed command, with README `packages/AdicSpacesPartIIPartII/README.md`, name `AdicSpacesPartIIPartII`, order `merge-order/ORDER.txt` and `--movable`, exited 0 and printed:

```text
moved: AdicSpacesPartIIPartII moved in the merge order from #9 to #10, right after its last supplier AdicSpacesPartIII; checked as moved (the worker moves it there when it submits)
depcheck: 48 roadmaps, 539 edges, 0 problem(s)
```

There is no UPWARD or CYCLE line. The formal supplier remains its actual owner, rather than being re-planned here. The authorized movable check handles the placement; merge-order files were not edited.

- Citation resolution exited 0 against main b41e47b and 352 indexed open heads: “Cross-roadmap citations found nowhere: None”; “Lean names found nowhere: None.” Its note that external Lean names were not checked by that tool was addressed by direct reads at the manifest pins, including the F08 declarations listed above.
- `git diff --check` exited 0. JSON comparison with the pre-edit design confirmed that only the top-level gaps list changed. All three gap needs sentences agree exactly with their README contracts. Suggested.lean has one Mathlib import, one used TauCeti import, four declarations, three theorem sorries, no admitted data, no options and no added Check declarations. No initial gate failures were supplied in the brief.

## Maintainer consequences

The three supplier gaps remain explicit requests, not declarations invented in other roadmaps. The worker’s dependency result calls for placement immediately after AdicSpacesPartIII. The title question remains for the maintainer. DiamondsAndVStacks D6.9, ReductiveGroupsPartII RG2.0.2 and AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuliPartII B2.10 may reuse the indicated general results; their files were not edited. No exported Lean declaration was renamed or deleted. Metadata was unchanged. No commit, push or external write was made. This report records repairs and checks; it does not replace the fresh independent review.
