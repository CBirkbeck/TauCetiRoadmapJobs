# Refined trace methods, part II: target signatures

The roadmap is `README.md`; this file is not the roadmap. It states, against the pinned Mathlib
and Tau Ceti, the headline theorems of the roadmap that are statable there, each with `sorry`,
together with the few definitions they need.

The statable headlines are the counting theorems that fix the sizes of the answers: the
cardinality of the cusp truncation set `S(a,b,r)` and Sylvester's count for its coprime part
`T(a,b,r)`, which is the length of the cusp K-group `K_{2r}` (README §1.1), and the closed formula
for the number of words without cyclic repetitions, which gives the multiplicities in the
coordinate-axes formulas (README §1.4).

The following headline theorems are not statable at the pins, because Mathlib and Tau Ceti have
no algebraic K-theory, no topological Hochschild homology or topological cyclic homology, no
cyclic homology, no big Witt vectors, no predicate for perfectoid rings, no de Rham–Witt complex
and no syntomic complexes:

* Hesselholt's formula for `K_q(k[x,y]/(xy),(x,y))` over a regular noetherian `𝔽_p`-algebra
  (README §5.2): it lacks algebraic K-theory and the de Rham–Witt complex.
* Speirs' formulas for the K-theory of the coordinate axes in affine `d`-space over perfect fields
  and over ind-smooth `ℚ`-algebras (README §§5.3–5.4): they lack algebraic K-theory, big or
  p-typical Witt-vector valued K-groups and cyclic homology.
* The Hesselholt–Nikolaus theorem `K_{2r}(k[x,y]/(y^a − x^b),(x,y)) ≅
  W_S(k)/(V_a W_{S/a}(k) + V_b W_{S/b}(k))` over perfect `𝔽_p`-algebras (README §6.2): it lacks
  algebraic K-theory and big Witt vectors.
* Riggenbach's theorem `K_{2r−1}(R[x]/x^e,(x);ℤ_p) ≅ W_{re}(R)/V_e W_r(R)` over perfectoid rings
  (README §7.2): it lacks algebraic K-theory, big Witt vectors and perfectoid rings.
* The Antieau–Krause–Nikolaus theorems on finite chain rings `O_K/ϖ^n`: the structure of the
  p-adic K-groups through syntomic cohomology, Angeltveit's order quotient, the even vanishing
  theorem and the nilpotence bound for `v₁` (README §§9.2, 9.3, 9.5, 9.6): they lack algebraic
  K-theory and syntomic complexes.
* Prismatic cohomology relative to a δ-ring, its filtered variant and crystalline degeneration
  (README Layer 8): they lack δ-rings, prisms and prismatic cohomology.

/-- The cusp counting function `ℓ(a,b,m)`: the number of pairs `(i,j)` of positive integers with
`a * i + b * j = m` (hn-cusp line 20). For positive `a` and `b` every such pair has `i, j ≤ m`. -/

`½(a+1)(b+1) − 1 + rab` (hesselholt-cusp-polytopes Corollary 1.6). Since `Set.ncard` vanishes on
infinite sets, the identity also asserts finiteness. -/
