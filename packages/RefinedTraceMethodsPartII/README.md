# Roadmap: refined trace methods, part II — K-theory of curve singularities, truncated polynomials and finite chain rings

**Summary.** This roadmap turns the trace machinery of RefinedTraceMethods into closed formulas for the algebraic K-theory of the standard singular and finite rings. It builds the Nikolaus–Scholze calculus of pointed-monoid algebras: the cyclotomic splitting `THH(k(Π)) ≃ THH(k) ⊗ Σ^∞B^cy(Π)` with its unstable Frobenius, the circle-cell Tate calculus over perfect and perfectoid coefficients, and the passage from K to TC through normalization squares. It then proves the end theorems. Over a regular noetherian 𝔽_p-algebra k, `K_q(k[x,y]/(xy),(x,y))` is a sum of p-typical de Rham–Witt groups of k (Hesselholt). The relative K-groups of the coordinate axes in affine d-space are computed over every perfect field of positive characteristic, including p = 2, and over every ind-smooth ℚ-algebra (Speirs). For the planar cusps `y^a = x^b` over perfect 𝔽_p-algebras, the even relative K-groups are `W_S(k)/(V_aW_{S/a}(k) + V_bW_{S/b}(k))` and the odd ones vanish (Hesselholt–Nikolaus). For every perfectoid ring R, `K_{2r−1}(R[x]/x^e,(x);ℤ_p) ≅ W_{re}(R)/V_eW_r(R)` and the even groups vanish (Riggenbach). Finally, for every finite chain ring `O_K/ϖ^n` it gives the structure of the p-adic K-groups, Angeltveit's order quotient, the even vanishing theorem and the bound on v₁-nilpotence (Antieau–Krause–Nikolaus), with the relative and filtered prismatic cohomology over δ-rings that these need.

## Scope and ownership

This roadmap owns the following.

- The cyclotomic splitting of THH of pointed-monoid algebras in the Nikolaus–Scholze framework, with its unstable Frobenius, and the rational Hochschild analogue (Layer 2).
- The weight decompositions and circle-equivariant cell types of the cyclic bar constructions of the coordinate-axes monoids and of the cusp inclusion `⟨t^a,t^b⟩ ⊂ ⟨t⟩` (Layer 2).
- The circle-cell Tate calculus: the Tate comparison for finite C_p-complexes, the Frobenius on fixed-point cells, the circle-orbit identity, the homotopy of `THH(R;ℤ_p)^{hC_{p^v}}` and `THH(R;ℤ_p)^{tC_{p^v}}` for perfectoid R with their canonical, Frobenius and Verschiebung maps, and the staircase lemma that evaluates the Nikolaus–Scholze equalizer on such pieces (Layer 3).
- Birelative K-theory and TC of normalization squares, the conductor squares of numerical-semigroup rings, and the comparison of relative with birelative K-theory (Layer 4).
- The calculations for the coordinate axes (Layer 5), the planar cusps (Layer 6), the truncated polynomial algebras over perfectoid rings (Layer 7) and finite chain rings (Layer 9).
- Prismatic and syntomic cohomology relative to a δ-ring, its filtered variant and crystalline degeneration, as far as Layer 9 uses them (Layer 8). No prismatic roadmap plans prismatic cohomology relative to δ-rings or of filtered rings.
- The arithmetic of the indexing data: the cusp counting function and its truncation sets, Sylvester's count, cyclic-word counts, the axes and cusp index functions, and the finite-chain-ring exponents (Layer 1).

The following are imported, not planned again.

- THH of E₁-rings with its Frobenius, symmetric monoidality, TC and its fibre formula, spherical monoid rings with the unstable Frobenius of an unpointed E₁-monoid, parametrized Tate constructions and dualizing spectra, representation-graded TR, relative K and TC with `K^inv`, the Dundas–Goodwillie–McCarthy theorem, henselian rigidity, Goodwillie's rational theorem, truncating excision with the Land–Tamme correction and the KABI consequence, and continuity: RefinedTraceMethods §§1.4, 1.9, 2.3–2.4, 2.6, 2.8–2.10, 2.13, 4.12, 4.17–4.18.
- Pointed-monoid THH in the classical genuine model and the cell types of `B^cy(Π_e)`, the big Witt power-series comparison, λ-graded TR of regular noetherian 𝔽_p-algebras and the truncated-polynomial K-groups over regular noetherian 𝔽_p-algebras and perfect fields: KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §§5.16, 5.16a, 5.17. The truncated-polynomial theorem over perfect fields is a Check of Layer 7 here, not a target. K-theory of finite fields, Gabber rigidity and TC of perfect fields come from KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §§1.1–1.6, 2.1 and 5.1.
- Truncation sets, big Witt rings, F, V and Teichmüller maps and the comparison with p-typical Witt vectors: QWittVectors §§1.1–1.5. p-typical de Rham–Witt complexes: CrystallineCohomology CR.4.
- Vanishing of NK for regular noetherian rings: SchemeKTheoryOperations §5.2. Relative K-theory as a fibre: GeneralAlgebraicKTheory §8.1.
- δ-rings, prisms, Breuil–Kisin prisms and prismatic envelopes: PrismaticCohomology §§0.55–0.56, 0.73–0.76, 0.93 and 2.13. Nygaard filtrations, Breuil–Kisin twists, the ideals `I_r` of transversal prisms, Nygaard completion, the Cartier–Witt stack, prismatic crystals and absolute prismatic and Hodge–Tate cohomology: PrismaticCohomologyPartII §§3.6, 3.9–3.10, 3.20 and Layer 4. Syntomic complexes and the motivic filtration on TC: PrismaticCohomologyPartIII §§6.8–6.9, 6.28, 6.31 and 7.0. Perfectoid rings, `A_inf`, Bökstedt periodicity for perfectoid rings and the perfectoid trace coefficients: AInfCohomology AI.0 and §AI.7.2.

What is left out:

- The algorithmic content of the finite-chain-ring calculation (akn24 §7 and its tables), whose values enter only as Checks.
- The chromatic purity theorem, owned by GeneralAlgebraicKTheoryPartII (its target "The chromatic purity theorem", in the layer on trace comparison, CMNN vanishing and purity). At height one it gives `L_{T(1)}K(ℤ/p^n) = L_{T(1)}K(0) = 0` because ℤ/p^n is T(0)- and T(1)-acyclic. Here `L_{T(1)}K(ℤ/p^n) = 0` appears only as a consequence of the v₁-nilpotence theorem (§9.6), by a route independent of purity.
- K-theory of `O_K` and of local fields, owned by KTheoryFiniteLocalFields Layer 6.
- Hahn–Levy–Senger's mod (p, v₁) calculation.
- The F-smooth extension of the truncated-polynomial theorem (riggenbach-trunc Theorem 1.2) and the rational cusp calculation. Both need inputs that no supplier provides: the Nygaard-dimension theory of F-smooth rings, and the cyclic homology of cusp algebras over ℚ-algebras. They lie outside this roadmap, which stops at perfectoid coefficients for truncated polynomials and at perfect 𝔽_p-algebras for cusps.

## Conventions

Rings are commutative and unital unless they are E₁-ring spectra. K is connective algebraic K-theory and IK the nonconnective theory, as in RefinedTraceMethods; `K^inv = fib(IK → TC)`. For a ring map f : A → B and a common ideal I, `K(A,I) = fib(IK(A) → IK(A/I))` and the birelative term `K(A,B,I)` is the total fibre of the square `IK(A) → IK(A/I)` over `IK(B) → IK(B/I)`; similarly for THH, TC, HH and HC. For a prime p, `F(−;ℤ_p)` is the p-completion of a spectrum-valued invariant F.

Homological grading is used for spectra and mixed complexes. `TC^-(X) = X^{hT}`, `TP(X) = X^{tT}` and `can` is the canonical map. The circle norm is `ΣX_{hT} → X^{hT}`. In a residual action, T/C_m is identified with T by `z ↦ z^m`. `C(i)` is the complex T-representation on which `z` acts by `z^i`, and `λ_d = C(1) ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ C(d)`, with `λ_0 = 0`.

A pointed monoid is a monoid Π with an absorbing element 0, that is a `MonoidWithZero` of Mathlib. Its pointed monoid algebra is `k(Π) = k[Π]/k·[0]`. The reduced cyclic bar construction `B^cy(Π)` is the realization of the pointed cyclic set `[n] ↦ Π^{∧(n+1)}`. For an unpointed monoid M, `M_+ = M ⊔ {0}` is pointed and `k(M_+) = k[M]`.

Big Witt vectors use QWittVectors' coordinate model on a truncation set S. `W_S(R)` has F_n, V_n and Teichmüller maps. `W_N(R)` means `W_{{1,…,N}}(R)`, with `W_0(R) = 0`. The power-series comparison `γ_N(a) = ∏ (1 − a_d t^d)^{−1}` of QWittVectors §1.4a and KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.16a fixes signs: `γ_1(a) = 1 + at`. Mathlib's `WittVector p R` and `TruncatedWittVector p n R` are the p-typical carriers; `W_s(R)` denotes the p-typical Witt vectors of length s, with `W_0 = 0`. For a positive integer d prime to p and a truncation set S, put `s_S(d) = #{j ≥ 0 : dp^j ∈ S}`. For S = {1,…,m} this is the unique s ≥ 1 with `p^{s−1}d ≤ m < p^s d`, written `s(m,d)`, when d ≤ m. `J_p` is the set of positive integers prime to p.

Prismatic conventions follow PrismaticCohomologyPartII and PrismaticCohomologyPartIII. `Δ_R{i}` is the Breuil–Kisin twisted absolute prismatic cohomology, `N^{≥i}Δ̂_R{i}` its Nygaard filtration, and `ℤ_p(i)(R) = fib(can − φ_i : N^{≥i}Δ̂_R{i} → Δ̂_R{i})`. Cohomological degrees are written `H^j`, with `H^j(C) = π_{−j}(C)`. For a δ-ring A and an A-algebra R, `Δ_{R/A}` is the prismatic package of Layer 8.

A finite chain ring is `R = O_K/ϖ^n` with K/ℚ_p finite, `e = v_K(p)`, residue field `𝔽_q` with q = p^f, and n ≥ 1. Put `j = ⌈n/e⌉` (the exponent of the additive group of R) and `[j]_p = 1 + p + ⋯ + p^{j−1}`. The class `v₁ ∈ H⁰(𝔽_p(p−1)(ℤ_p))` is akn24's; for p odd it is the image of the Adams class.

**Pinned witnesses.**

- *Witt sign.* Over ℤ, `τ(1) + τ(1) = (2,−1)` in `W_{{1,2}}(ℤ)`, and `γ_2(2,−1) = 1 + 2t + 3t² mod t³`. A componentwise sum would give `1 + 2t + 4t²`.
- *Verschiebung.* `V_1` is the identity, so the quotient `W_{re}(R)/V_eW_r(R)` vanishes at e = 1. For k = 𝔽_2, `W_{{1,2}}(𝔽_2) ≅ W_2(𝔽_2) = ℤ/4` and `V_2W_1(𝔽_2) = 2ℤ/4`, so `W_2(𝔽_2)/V_2W_1(𝔽_2) = ℤ/2`. This is the order of the principal units `1 + x𝔽_2[x]/x²`.
- *Tate grading.* For trivial C_p acting on Hℤ, `π_{2r}((Hℤ)^{tC_p}) = ℤ/p` and the odd groups vanish (RefinedTraceMethods §2.13 Examples).
- *Circle cells.* `(X ⊗ (T/C_m)_+)^{hT} ≃ Σ X^{hC_m}`. For X = Hℤ with trivial action and m = 1 this is `ΣHℤ`, with π₁ = ℤ. An unshifted formula would put ℤ in degree 0.
- *Syntomic degrees.* `ℤ_p(1)` is the derived p-completion of `G_m[−1]` (akn-delta line 119), so for a local ring R with finite unit group `H¹(ℤ_p(1)(R))` is the p-primary part of `R^×`. For R = ℤ/4 this is `(ℤ/4)^× = ℤ/2 = K_1(ℤ/4;ℤ_2)`, in cohomological degree 1, not 0.

## How to read the build

Layer 1 is elementary arithmetic and Witt bookkeeping, close to Mathlib: it fixes every index function that appears in an answer. Layer 2 splits THH of a pointed-monoid algebra as THH of the coefficients tensored with a cyclic bar construction, and computes the circle-equivariant cell types of the three cyclic bar constructions the calculations need. Layer 3 develops the Tate calculus on circle cells over perfectoid coefficients, ending in the staircase lemma that evaluates the TC equalizer on a tower of cells. Layer 4 reduces relative K-theory of a normalization square to birelative TC (p-adically) and to birelative HC (rationally). Layers 5, 6 and 7 assemble the calculations for the coordinate axes, the cusps and the truncated polynomial algebras. Layer 8 builds prismatic cohomology relative to δ-rings and of filtered rings, with crystalline degeneration. Layer 9 applies Layers 3, 7 and 8 to finite chain rings. Layers 5–7 are independent of each other, and Layer 8 depends only on suppliers.

## Layer 1: Indexing arithmetic and Witt bookkeeping

This layer fixes every index function that appears in an answer below and proves its elementary properties. Everything here is statable on Mathlib's `ℕ`, `Finset`, `Nat.divisors`, `ArithmeticFunction.moebius` and the big Witt carrier of QWittVectors.

### 1.1 The cusp counting function and its truncation sets

Define the cusp counting function `cuspCount a b m`, written `ℓ(a,b,m)`: for positive integers a, b and m ≥ 0, it is the number of pairs (i,j) of positive integers with `ai + bj = m`. For r ≥ 0 define the set `cuspTruncationSet a b r`, written `S(a,b,r) = {m ≥ 1 : ℓ(a,b,m) ≤ r}`, and its coprime part `cuspCoprimeSet a b r`, written `T(a,b,r) = {m ∈ S(a,b,r) : a ∤ m and b ∤ m}` (hn-cusp line 20; hesselholt-cusp-polytopes line 384). In the Lean statements both sets are subsets of ℕ and their sizes are `Set.ncard`, which is 0 on an infinite set; the cardinality formulas below therefore also assert finiteness.

- For coprime a, b ≥ 2 and every m ≥ 1, `ℓ(a,b,m+ab) = ℓ(a,b,m) + 1`. If `rab + 1 ≤ m ≤ (r+1)ab`, then ℓ(a,b,m) ∈ {r, r+1}, and ℓ(a,b,m) = r if a | m or b | m (hesselholt-cusp-polytopes Lemma 1.4(1)–(2), line 329).
- If s divides m then ℓ(a,b,s) ≤ ℓ(a,b,m), for all positive a, b. Hence S(a,b,r) is closed under positive divisors and is a truncation set in the sense of QWittVectors §1.1 (hesselholt-cusp-polytopes Lemma 1.4(5)).
- S(a,b,r) ⊆ S(a,b,r+1), and every positive integer lies in S(a,b,r) for r large.
- `ncard_cuspTruncationSet`: for coprime a, b ≥ 2 and r ≥ 0, S(a,b,r) is finite with `#S(a,b,r) = ½(a+1)(b+1) − 1 + rab`, stated without subtraction or halving as `2·#S(a,b,r) + 2 = (a+1)(b+1) + 2rab` (hesselholt-cusp-polytopes Corollary 1.6, line 386).
- For coprime a, b ≥ 2: `#(S(a,b,r)/a) = (r+1)b`, `#(S(a,b,r)/b) = (r+1)a` and `#(S(a,b,r)/ab) = r+1` (hesselholt-cusp-polytopes Corollary 1.6, line 386).
- *Sylvester's count* (`ncard_cuspCoprimeSet`). For coprime a, b ≥ 2 and r ≥ 0, the set T(a,b,r) is a finite truncation set with `2·#T(a,b,r) = (2r+1)(a−1)(b−1)`. This is the length over W(k) of the cusp K-group `K_{2r}` of §6.2. The proof is inclusion–exclusion on the four cardinalities above (hesselholt-cusp-polytopes Corollary 1.7, line 395; hn-cusp line 37).
- *Conductor.* For coprime a, b ≥ 2, the least c such that every m ≥ c is a nonnegative combination of a and b is `(a−1)(b−1)` (hesselholt-cusp-polytopes Remark 1.5, line 373).

*Needs:* Mathlib `Finset.card`, `Set.ncard`, `Nat.Coprime`; QWittVectors §1.1 (truncation sets).

**Checks.**

- For (a,b,r) = (2,3,0): ℓ vanishes exactly on {1,2,3,4,6}, so S(2,3,0) = {1,2,3,4,6}. Its cardinality is 5 = ½·3·4 − 1, and T(2,3,0) = {1} has 1 = ½·1·1·2 element. Forgetting the positivity of i and j would put 6 = 2·3 + 3·0 outside S.
- For (2,3,1): S(2,3,1) = {1,…,10} ∪ {12}, of cardinality 11 = 5 + 6. Here ℓ(2,3,12) = 1 from (3,2) alone, while ℓ(2,3,11) = 2 from (4,1) and (1,3). T(2,3,1) = {1,5,7} has 3 = ½·3·2 elements.
- For (2,3,2): T(2,3,2) = {1,5,7,11,13}, of cardinality 5. For (2,5,0): S(2,5,0) = {1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10} and T(2,5,0) = {1,3}, of cardinality 2 = ½·1·4.
- Non-example: the set {2,3,4,6} fails divisor closure because it omits 1. A definition of S by "ℓ(a,b,m) < r" would make S(2,3,0) empty and Sylvester's count false at r = 0.

### 1.2 Restriction to the coprime part

For a truncation set S, positive integers n_1, …, n_k and `T = {m ∈ S : n_i ∤ m for all i}`, the set T is a truncation set. For every commutative ring R, the restriction `R^S_T : W_S(R) → W_T(R)` is surjective with kernel `Σ_i V_{n_i}W_{S/n_i}(R)` (hesselholt-cusp-polytopes Corollary 1.7 proof, line 398). Prove it from the coordinate expansion `x = Σ_{d∈S} V_dτ(x_d)` of QWittVectors §1.4: the kernel of restriction consists of the vectors whose coordinates vanish on T, and these are exactly the sums of `V_{n_i}`-images. In particular `W_S(k)/(V_aW_{S/a}(k) + V_bW_{S/b}(k)) ≅ W_{T(a,b,r)}(k)` for S = S(a,b,r), and `W_{re}(R)/V_eW_r(R) ≅ W_{T_{r,e}}(R)` with `T_{r,e} = {m ≤ re : e ∤ m}`.

*Needs:* QWittVectors §§1.3–1.4 (restriction, V_n, τ and the coordinate expansion).

**Checks.**

- For S = {1,2}, n_1 = 2 and R = 𝔽_2: `W_{{1,2}}(𝔽_2) = ℤ/4` (by QWittVectors §1.5), `V_2W_{{1}}(𝔽_2) = {0,2}` and `W_{{1}}(𝔽_2) = 𝔽_2`. The quotient has two elements on both sides.
- For n_1 = 1 the set T is empty, `W_∅ = 0` and `V_1` is the identity, so both sides are zero. A version keeping the index 1 in T would give R instead of 0.
- Over ℤ with S = {1,2,3,4} and n_1 = 2: T = {1,3}. The vector `V_2τ(1)` has coordinates (0,1,0,0) and restricts to 0, while τ(1) restricts to (1,0) ≠ 0. Keeping 2 in T would give the truncation set {1,2,3}, and a quotient of length 3 over W(ℤ) instead of 2 = #T.

### 1.3 The p-typical index functions

For a prime p, a truncation set S and d ∈ S ∩ J_p, put `s_S(d) = #{j ≥ 0 : dp^j ∈ S}`. For S = {1,…,m} and d ≤ m this is the unique s ≥ 1 with `p^{s−1}d ≤ m < p^s d`, written s(m,d) (hesselholt-axes line 41). For the cusp, put `s = s(a,b,r,p,m′)`, the unique s ≥ 1 with `ℓ(a,b,p^{s−1}m′) ≤ r < ℓ(a,b,p^s m′)`, or 0 if none exists. Assume p ∤ b, write `a = p^u a′` with p ∤ a′, and put h = s if neither a′ nor b divides m′, h = min{s,u} if a′ but not b divides m′, and h = 0 if b divides m′ (hn-cusp lines 43–57).

- `Σ_{d ∈ S∩J_p} s_S(d) = #S` for every finite truncation set S.
- For the cusp, `h(a,b,r,p,m′) = s_{T(a,b,r)}(m′)` whenever m′ ∈ J_p. Hence `Σ_{m′∈J_p} h(a,b,r,p,m′) = ½(2r+1)(a−1)(b−1)`.

*Needs:* §1.1; Mathlib `Nat.Prime`, `Nat.Coprime`.

**Checks.**

- (a,b,r,p) = (2,3,0,2): u = 1, a′ = 1. For m′ = 1, s = 3 because ℓ vanishes on 1, 2, 4 and ℓ(2,3,8) = 1; since a′ | 1, h = min{3,1} = 1. For m′ = 3, h = 0 because b | 3. For m′ = 5, s = 0 because ℓ(2,3,5) = 1, so h = 0. Total 1 = #T(2,3,0), and `s_{{1}}(1) = 1`.
- (2,3,0,5): u = 0. For m′ = 1, s = 1 since ℓ(2,3,5) = 1, and neither 2 nor 3 divides 1, so h = 1. Every other m′ gives h = 0. Total 1.
- For S = {1,…,4} and p = 2, the indices are d ∈ {1,3} with s_S(1) = 3 and s_S(3) = 1; the sum 4 = #S. Using the convention "s ≥ 0 with p^s d ≤ m" would give s_S(1) = 2 and total 3.

### 1.4 Cyclic words and the axes indices

For d ≥ 1 and s ≥ 1, let `cyc_d(s)` be the number of cyclic words of length s and period s in d letters having no cyclic repetitions: consecutive letters differ, and so do the last and the first (speirs-axes line 17, Definition 8). Let `A_d(m)` count the words of length m with no cyclic repetitions. For d ≥ 2 put `c_{d−1}(m) = Σ_{s | m, s ≡ m mod 2} cyc_d(s)`. For a prime p, r ≥ 0 and m′ ≥ 1, let `t_ev(p,r,m′)` be the unique t ≥ 1 with `p^{t−1}m′ ≤ 2r < p^t m′`, and `t_od(p,r,m′)` the unique t ≥ 1 with `p^{t−1}m′ ≤ 2r+1 < p^t m′`. Each is 0 if no such t exists (speirs-axes line 23).

- `card_noCyclicRepetition`: for every d ≥ 0 and m ≥ 1, the number of maps `w : Fin m → Fin d` with `w(i) ≠ w(i+1)` for every i, indices read cyclically through `finRotate m`, is `A_d(m) = (d−1)^m + (−1)^m(d−1)`, an identity in ℤ (speirs-axes Lemma 33, line 1250, for d ≥ 1; for d = 0 both sides are 0). For m = 1 the condition `w(0) ≠ w(0)` is never met and both sides are 0. For m = 0 the empty word would be counted once while the right side is d, so m ≥ 1 is needed.
- `A_d(m) = Σ_{s|m} s·cyc_d(s)`, hence by Möbius inversion `cyc_d(s) = (1/s)Σ_{j|s} μ(s/j)A_d(j)` (speirs-axes line 1264).
- `cyc_d(1) = 0` and `cyc_d(2) = d(d−1)/2`; for d = 2, cyc_2(s) = 0 unless s = 2.
- `t_od(p,r,m′) = t_ev(p,r,m′)` unless `p^{t−1}m′ = 2r+1` for t = t_od. For m′ = 2r+1 and every p, t_od = 1 and t_ev = 0.

*Needs:* Mathlib `Nat.divisors`, `ArithmeticFunction.moebius`, `ArithmeticFunction.moebius_mul_coe_zeta`, `finRotate`.

**Checks.**

- For d = 3: A_3(2) = 6, A_3(3) = 6, A_3(4) = 18 and A_3(6) = 66. The counts are cyc_3(2) = 3, cyc_3(3) = 2, cyc_3(4) = 3 and cyc_3(6) = (66 − 6 − 6 + 0)/6 = 9 (speirs-axes line 1282).
- For d = 2: A_2(m) is 2 for m even and 0 for m odd, so `cyc_2(2) = 1` and cyc_2(4) = (2 − 2)/4 = 0. A count of words that allowed one cyclic repetition would make cyc_2(4) nonzero.
- `c_1(m)` is 1 for m even and 0 for m odd, and c_2(2) = 3. For (p,r,m′) = (2,1,3): t_od = 1 and t_ev = 0, so the two functions differ.

### 1.5 Finite-chain-ring exponents

For a finite chain ring with invariants (p, e, f, n) put `j = ⌈n/e⌉`, `[j]_p = (p^j − 1)/(p − 1)`, and define the even-vanishing threshold `B(p,e,n) = (p/(p−1))·(p[j]_p − p^j(j − n/e))`, a rational number (akn24 Theorem 5.2, line 2074). For i, n ≥ 1, let `ε(i,j′) = 1` if `⌊j′/n⌋ < ⌈j′/n⌉ ≤ i`, and 0 otherwise (akn24 line 443).

- For 1 ≤ j′ ≤ in − 1, ε(i,j′) = 1 exactly when n ∤ j′. Hence `Σ_{j′=1}^{in−1} ε(i,j′) = i(n−1)` (akn24 lines 448–452).
- `j − n/e ∈ [0, 1)`, so `B(p,e,n) ≤ p²(p^j − 1)/(p−1)²`, the bound of akn24 Remark 5.4 (line 2078).
- For n ≤ e, j = 1 and `B(p,e,n) = p²n/((p−1)e)`.

*Needs:* Mathlib `Nat.ceil`, `Rat`.

**Checks.**

- For ℤ/4 (p = 2, e = 1, n = 2): j = 2, [2]_2 = 3 and B = 2·(2·3 − 4·0) = 12. The even vanishing theorem therefore applies from i = 13.
- For 𝔽_2[z]/z³, viewed as `O_K/ϖ³` with e = 3: j = 1 and B = 4·3/3 = 4, so i ≥ 5. As e → ∞ the threshold tends to 0. The weaker bound p²(p^j − 1)/(p − 1)² = 4 does not tend to 0.
- For i = 2 and n = 2, the indices 1 ≤ j′ ≤ 3 not divisible by 2 are {1,3}, so the count is 2 = 2·1. For n = 1 every j′ is divisible by n and the count is 0 = i·0. This is consistent with `|K_{2i−1}(𝔽_q)|/|K_{2i−2}(𝔽_q)| = q^i − 1` being prime to p.

### Examples

For (a,b) = (2,3) the truncation sets are S(2,3,0) = {1,2,3,4,6} and S(2,3,1) = {1,…,10,12}, with coprime parts {1} and {1,5,7}. For d = 3 the first word counts are cyc_3(2), …, cyc_3(6) = 3, 2, 3, 6, 9. For ℤ/p^n the exponent is j = n and the threshold is p²(p^n − 1)/(p−1)².

## Layer 2: Pointed-monoid algebras and their cyclic bar constructions

### 2.1 Pointed-monoid algebras

Define the pointed-monoid algebra `k(Π)` of a commutative ring k and a pointed monoid Π (a `MonoidWithZero`) as the quotient of `MonoidAlgebra k Π` by the ideal generated by the basis element of 0 (speirs-axes line 286; hn-cusp line 105).

- The images of the nonzero elements of Π form a k-basis of k(Π).
- *Universal property.* k-algebra maps k(Π) → B correspond to maps of monoids with zero from Π to the multiplicative monoid of B.
- k(Π) is functorial in maps of monoids with zero and in ring maps k → k′, with `k′ ⊗_k k(Π) ≅ k′(Π)`.
- `k(Π) ⊗_k k(Π′) ≅ k(Π ∧ Π′)`, where `Π ∧ Π′` is the smash product of pointed monoids.
- For an unpointed monoid M, `k(M_+) ≅ MonoidAlgebra k M`.
- `MonoidAlgebra k Π ≅ k × k(Π)` as k-algebras, because the basis element of 0 is a central idempotent.

*Needs:* Mathlib `MonoidAlgebra`, `MonoidWithZero`, `Ideal.Quotient.mk`.

**Checks.**

- For Π_0 = {0,1}, k(Π_0) = k, while the unquotiented `MonoidAlgebra k Π_0` is k × k of rank 2.
- For `Π_e = {0,1,x,…,x^{e−1}}` with x^e = 0, `k(Π_e) ≅ k[x]/x^e` has rank e. The unquotiented `MonoidAlgebra k Π_e` has rank e + 1, so omitting the quotient fails already at e = 1.
- For `Π_d = {0} ∪ {x_i^n : 1 ≤ i ≤ d, n ≥ 0}` with x_ix_j = 0 for i ≠ j, `k(Π_d) ≅ k[x_1,…,x_d]/(x_ix_j)_{i≠j}`. For d = 2 this is the node `k[x,y]/(xy)` of the supplier contract.
- For the numerical semigroup `⟨t^a,t^b⟩ ⊂ ⟨t⟩`, `k(⟨t^a,t^b⟩_+) ≅ k[t^a,t^b] ≅ k[x,y]/(y^a − x^b)` for coprime a, b (hn-cusp line 89).

### 2.2 The reduced cyclic bar construction and the unstable Frobenius

For a pointed monoid Π, define the pointed cyclic set `B^cy(Π)[n] = Π^{∧(n+1)}`, with the Hochschild face maps, degeneracies inserting 1 and cyclic operator `t_n(π_0∧⋯∧π_n) = π_n∧π_0∧⋯∧π_{n−1}`. Its realization `B^cy(Π)` is a pointed T-space (speirs-axes §3.1, line 206). For every prime p, the unstable Frobenius `ψ_p : B^cy(Π) → B^cy(Π)^{C_p}` is the composite of the simplicial diagonal into the C_p-fixed points of the p-fold edgewise subdivision with the subdivision homeomorphism D_p. It is a T ≅ T/C_p-equivariant homeomorphism onto the genuine fixed points (speirs-axes lines 223–255).

- B^cy(Π) is functorial in maps of monoids with zero, with `B^cy(Π_0) = S⁰` and `B^cy(M_+) = B^cy(M)_+` for an unpointed monoid M.
- *Smash products.* `B^cy(Π ∧ Π′) ≃ B^cy(Π) ∧ B^cy(Π′)` T-equivariantly, compatibly with ψ_p.
- *Weights.* A map `w : Π ∖ {0} → (ℕ,+)` with w(πσ) = w(π) + w(σ) whenever πσ ≠ 0 splits `B^cy(Π) = ⋁_{m≥0} B^cy(Π;m)` as pointed T-spaces, and ψ_p restricts to homeomorphisms `B^cy(Π;m) → B^cy(Π;pm)^{C_p}`. The same holds for a word grading by cyclic words (speirs-axes line 331).
- Composing ψ_p with the map from genuine to homotopy fixed points gives the Borel unstable Frobenius `B^cy(Π) → B^cy(Π)^{hC_p}`. For Π = M_+ it agrees with RefinedTraceMethods §2.10's ψ_p.

*Needs:* RefinedTraceMethods §2.5 (cyclic realization and edgewise subdivision) and §2.10; KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §4.0 (cyclic sets and genuine T-spaces).

**Checks.**

- For Π_0, B^cy(Π_0) = S⁰ with trivial action and ψ_p the identity of S⁰. A definition that forgot the basepoint would give S⁰ ∨ S⁰.
- For Π = ⟨t⟩_+ = {0,1,t,t²,…} the weight-m piece is `(T/C_m)_+` for m ≥ 1 and S⁰ for m = 0 (hn-cusp line 122; speirs-axes line 1160). ψ_p sends weight m to weight pm, not to weight m.
- For Π_2 = {0,1,x}, x² = 0 (e = 2), the weight-1 piece is `(T/C_1)_+` and the weight-2 piece is the cofibre of `(T/C_1)_+ → (T/C_2)_+` (KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.16), which is not a point although e | 2.

### 2.3 The cyclotomic splitting

Prove that for every E₁-ring k and every pointed monoid Π, the E₁-ring `k(Π) := k ⊗ Σ^∞Π` satisfies `THH(k(Π)) ≃ THH(k) ⊗ Σ^∞B^cy(Π)` as cyclotomic spectra. For a discrete ring k this E₁-ring is the Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum of the pointed-monoid algebra of 2.1. Under the equivalence the Frobenius is the composite of `φ_p ⊗ Σ^∞ψ_p : THH(k) ⊗ Σ^∞B^cy(Π) → THH(k)^{tC_p} ⊗ Σ^∞B^cy(Π)^{hC_p}` with the lax structure map into `(THH(k) ⊗ Σ^∞B^cy(Π))^{tC_p}` (hn-cusp line 105; speirs-axes Lemma 4, line 272; speirs-trunc lines 319–346). In particular `THH(Σ^∞Π) ≃ Σ^∞B^cy(Π)` with Frobenius Σ^∞ψ_p followed by can.

The route: Σ^∞Π is an E₁-ring because Σ^∞ is symmetric monoidal from pointed spaces. RefinedTraceMethods §2.8 makes THH symmetric monoidal into cyclotomic spectra. The cyclic bar construction of Σ^∞Π is Σ^∞ of B^cy(Π)[−] levelwise, and the Tate diagonal of a suspension spectrum is Σ^∞ of the space-level diagonal (RefinedTraceMethods §2.10).

- Naturality in E₁-maps k → k′ and in maps of pointed monoids.
- Compatibility with weight decompositions: `THH(k(Π)) ≃ ⊕_m THH(k) ⊗ Σ^∞B^cy(Π;m)`, with φ_p carrying weight m into the Tate construction of weight pm.
- For Π = M_+ the equivalence is RefinedTraceMethods §2.10 tensored with THH(k). It agrees on underlying T-spectra with the classical equivalence of KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.16 through the genuine–modern comparison of KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §4.4.
- If the connectivity of B^cy(Π;m) tends to infinity with m, the sum is also the product, and `(⊕_m X_m)^{tT} ≃ ∏_m X_m^{tT}`. Here X_m = THH(k) ⊗ Σ^∞B^cy(Π;m), whose connectivity also tends to infinity (speirs-axes Lemma 21, line 709).

*Needs:* RefinedTraceMethods §§2.6, 2.8, 2.10; §2.2 here; AInfCohomology §AI.7.2 (circle Tate construction).

**Checks.**

- For Π = Π_0, the statement is the identity `THH(k) ≃ THH(k)`. For k = 𝕊 and Π = ⟨t⟩_+, THH(𝕊[t]) ≃ Σ^∞B^cy(ℕ)_+, whose weight-1 summand is `Σ^∞(T/C_1)_+`. Its π₀ is ℤ, generated by the class of t.
- For k = 𝔽_p and Π = Π_2 in weight 1, `π_*(THH(𝔽_p) ⊗ Σ^∞T_+) = 𝔽_p[u] ⊗ H_*(T_+;𝔽_p)` has dimension one in every degree n ≥ 0. A splitting with the unreduced B^cy would add a copy of THH(𝔽_p) for the basepoint and double the dimension in even degrees.
- The Frobenius on weight 1 lands in weight p, so it cannot be the identity on summands. For Π_e with e = p, weight 1 maps to weight p, where e | p and the cofibre term of 2.2 appears.

### 2.4 The linear and rational splittings

For a commutative ring k and a pointed monoid Π, prove `HH(k(Π)/k) ≃ k ⊗ Σ^∞B^cy(Π)` (the reduced chains `C̃_*(B^cy(Π);k)` with their circle action) and `HH(k(Π)/ℤ) ≃ HH(k/ℤ) ⊗ Σ^∞B^cy(Π)`. Both are equivalences of T-equivariant objects of D(k), resp. D(ℤ), natural in k and Π and compatible with weights (speirs-axes Lemma 29, line 1128). Over ℚ, `HC(k(Π)/ℚ) = (HH(k/ℚ) ⊗ B^cy(Π))_{hT}`.

*Needs:* §2.2 (the T-space `B^cy(Π)`); RefinedTraceMethods §§1.4 and 2.6 (THH relative to an E∞-ring; THH(Hk/Hk′) ≃ HH); KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §4.0.

**Checks.**

- For Π = ⟨t⟩_+ = {0,1,t,t²,…} and k = ℚ, weight m ≥ 1 gives `HH(ℚ[t]/ℚ)_{(m)} = ℚ ⊗ (T/C_m)_+`, with homology ℚ in degrees 0 and 1 (the classes t^m and `t^(m−1) dt`). Connes' operator `B : HH_0 → HH_1` is multiplication by m, hence surjective, so the weight-m part of `HC_*(ℚ[t]/ℚ)` is ℚ·t^m in degree 0 and zero in every degree q ≥ 1; equivalently `(ℚ ⊗ (T/C_m)_+)_{hT} = ℚ_{hC_m} = ℚ` in degree 0. A computation claiming `HC_0 = 0` in weight m contradicts `HC_0(A) = HH_0(A) = A`.
- For k = 𝔽_2 and a word with s odd and i even (speirs-axes Proposition 12), the reduced homology is k/2k = 𝔽_2 in degree m − 1 and k[2] = 𝔽_2 in degree m. Over ℚ both vanish (line 456).
- For Π = M_+ the splitting is the Künneth formula `HH(k[M]/k) = k ⊗ B^cyM_+`.

### 2.5 Cell types: coordinate axes

For d ≥ 2 and the pointed monoid Π_d of 2.1, prove the following (speirs-axes Lemmas 6, 9 and 11 and Proposition 12, lines 334–464).

- *Word decomposition.* `B^cy(Π_d) = ⋁_ω B(ω)` over cyclic words ω in the letters x_1, …, x_d, with B(∅) = S⁰. The birelative term is `THH(A_d,B_d,I_d) ≃ ⊕_ω THH(k) ⊗ B(ω)`, summed over cyclic words of period at least 2, for every ring k.
- *Contractibility.* If ω has period at least 2 and a cyclic repetition, B(ω) is T-equivariantly contractible (speirs-axes Lemma 9(2), line 366). The words of period 1 are the powers `x_j^m` (m ≥ 1), which all have a cyclic repetition; `B(x_j^m)` is the weight-m part of `B^cy(⟨x_j⟩_+)`, hence `B(x_j^m) ≃ (T/C_m)_+`, which is not contractible (speirs-axes line 1160). These are the cells of the line `k[x_j]` and lie in the image of the normalization, which is why the birelative sum omits them.
- *Cell type.* If ω has period s ≥ 2, no cyclic repetition, length m and i = m/s blocks, then: for s even, `ΣB(ω) ≃ S^{λ_{m/2}} ∧ (T/C_i)_+`; for s and i odd, `B(ω) ≃ S^{λ_{(m−1)/2}} ∧ (T/C_i)_+`; for s odd and i even, `B(ω) ≃ S^{λ_{(m−2)/2}} ∧ RP²(i)`, where RP²(i) is the mapping cone of `(T/C_{i/2})_+ → (T/C_i)_+`.
- *Homology.* `H̃_*(B(ω);R)` is concentrated in degrees m − 1 and m. It is R in both degrees when s is even, or s and i are odd, with Connes' operator multiplication by i. When s is odd and i is even it is R/2 in degree m − 1 and R[2] in degree m, with Connes' operator zero.
- *Frobenius.* ψ_p restricts to homeomorphisms `B(ω) → B(ω^{⋆p})^{C_p}`, where `ω^{⋆p}` has length pm and the same period.

*Needs:* §1.4 (cyclic words, period and repetition); §§2.2–2.3; RefinedTraceMethods §2.13 (representation spheres).

**Checks.**

- For d = 2 the only cyclic words without repetition are `(x_1x_2)^i`, with s = 2. Thus `B(ω) ≃ Σ^{−1}S^{λ_i} ∧ (T/C_i)_+`, which recovers hesselholt-axes Proposition 1.2 (line 131).
- For d = 3 and ω = x_1x_2x_3 (m = s = 3, i = 1), `B(ω) ≃ S^{λ_1} ∧ T_+`, with reduced homology in degrees 2 and 3. Connes' operator is multiplication by i = 1.
- The word x_1x_1x_2 (period 3, with the repetition `w_1 = w_2`) has B(ω) contractible and contributes nothing. The word x_1x_1 has period 1: `B(x_1x_1) ≃ (T/C_2)_+` (speirs-axes line 1160) has reduced homology ℤ in degrees 0 and 1, so it is not contractible, and it is excluded from the birelative sum as a cell of `k[x_1]`. A contractibility statement without the period hypothesis would be refuted by it, and a decomposition that kept it would add `THH(k) ⊗ (T/C_2)_+` to the birelative term.

### 2.6 Cell types: truncated polynomials and cusps

For Π_e, import the cofibre sequences `S^{λ_d} ∧ (T/C_{s/e})_+ → S^{λ_d} ∧ (T/C_s)_+ → B^cy(Π_e;s)` with d = ⌊(s−1)/e⌋ from KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.16. These are statements about pointed T-spaces and hold in the Borel model used here (riggenbach-trunc Theorem 5.1, line 846). For the cusp put `B_m = B^cy(⟨t⟩,⟨t^a,t^b⟩;m)`, the weight-m part of the cofibre of `B^cy(⟨t^a,t^b⟩_+) → B^cy(⟨t⟩_+)`, and prove the following.

- `B_m ≃ T_+ ∧_{C_m} X(a,b,m)` for a finite pointed C_m-CW complex X(a,b,m), compatibly with the isomorphisms `ρ_s^*(B_m)^{C_s} ≅ B_{m/s}` for s | m (hesselholt-cusp-polytopes Proposition 3.1, line 792). Hence each B_m is a finite pointed T-CW complex.
- *Mixed complex.* For coprime a, b ≥ 2 and m ≥ 1, `ℤ ⊗ Σ^∞B_m` in `D(ℤ)^{BT}` is the total cofibre of the square of `ℤ ⊗ (T/C_{m/c})_+[2ℓ(a,b,m)]` for c ∈ {ab, a, b, 1}, with maps the canonical projections and with `T/C_{m/c}` empty when c ∤ m (hn-cusp Theorem 1, line 131). The input is the mixed complex of `ℤ[x,y]/(y^a − x^b)` (bach-hypersurfaces; larsen-mixed), translated through the formality of `C_*(T;ℤ)`.
- The connectivity of B_m tends to infinity with m, so `THH(k) ⊗ Σ^∞B^cy(⟨t⟩,⟨t^a,t^b⟩) ≃ ∏_{m≥1} THH(k) ⊗ Σ^∞B_m` (hn-cusp line 156).
- For p | m, the cofibre of `B_{m/p} →^{ψ_p} (B_m)^{C_p} → B_m` is a finite colimit of free C_p-cells (hn-cusp line 165, from hesselholt-cusp-polytopes §3).

*Needs:* §1.1 (the count ℓ(a,b,m)); §§2.2–2.4; KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.16; RefinedTraceMethods §§1.2–1.3 (mixed complexes and the coherent derived mixed category).

**Checks.**

- For (a,b) = (2,3) and m = 1, ℓ = 0 and only c = 1 divides m. Hence `ℤ ⊗ B_1 = ℤ ⊗ T_+`, with homology ℤ in degrees 0 and 1: the classes of t and dt not in the subalgebra.
- For m = 6 = ab, ℓ(2,3,6) = 0 and all four c divide 6. The total cofibre of the square of `(T/C_1)_+ → (T/C_3)_+`, `(T/C_2)_+ → (T/C_6)_+` is contractible, matching t⁶ ∈ k[t²,t³] together with all its cyclic words.
- For e = 1 in the truncated case the first map of each cofibre sequence is an equivalence, so every positive weight vanishes. This matches k[x]/x = k.

### Examples

For k = 𝔽_p and d = 2, the birelative THH is `⊕_{i≥1} Σ^{−1}THH(𝔽_p) ⊗ S^{λ_i} ∧ (T/C_i)_+`. The summand i has bottom cell in degree 2i − 1, so the lowest homotopy group is 𝔽_p in degree 1, from the word x_1x_2. For Π_e with e = p, the THH Connes differential on the divided-power classes has coefficient e/p = 1 and need not vanish, while the Hochschild one does (KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.16 Checks).

## Layer 3: Circle-cell Tate calculus over perfectoid coefficients

This layer computes `TC^-`, TP and the Frobenius on spectra of the form `THH(R;ℤ_p) ⊗ S^λ ∧ (T/C_m)_+` for a perfectoid ring R. It then proves the staircase lemma, which evaluates the Nikolaus–Scholze equalizer on a tower of such pieces. Perfect 𝔽_p-algebras are the perfectoid rings with p = 0. For them `A_inf(R) = W(R)`, the orientation is d = p, and every formula below specializes to the one in hn-cusp, speirs-trunc and speirs-axes.

### 3.1 Tate constructions of finite C_p-complexes

Prove the following for every spectrum T with C_p-action and every finite pointed C_p-CW complex Z (cells `C_p/H_+ ∧ D^n` with H ∈ {e, C_p}). The map `T^{tC_p} ⊗ Σ^∞Z^{C_p} → (T ⊗ Σ^∞Z)^{tC_p}` is an equivalence: it is induced by the inclusion of the C_p-fixed points, with trivial action on `Z^{C_p}`. The route is that `(T ⊗ Σ^∞Z^{C_p})^{tC_p} ≃ T^{tC_p} ⊗ Σ^∞Z^{C_p}` for finite `Z^{C_p}` with trivial action, and that the cofibre `Z/Z^{C_p}` is a finite colimit of free cells, on which `(T ⊗ −)^{tC_p}` vanishes (hn-cusp Lemma 2, line 162; speirs-trunc Lemma 8, line 347).

If T is bounded below, the lax structure map `T^{tC_p} ⊗ (Σ^∞Z)^{tC_p} → (T ⊗ Σ^∞Z)^{tC_p}` is an equivalence after p-completion of its source. It is not an equivalence before p-completion. The proof is speirs-axes Lemma 15 (line 506), whose statement must be read p-adically: the step `T^{tC_p} ⊗ 𝕊^∧_p ≃ T^{tC_p}` holds only after p-completion.

*Needs:* RefinedTraceMethods §2.3 (Tate vanishing on induced objects, p-completeness of `T^{tC_p}` for bounded-below T, `𝕊^{tC_p} ≃ 𝕊^∧_p`); BordismFormalGroups §F6.5 (the lax monoidal Tate functor).

**Checks.**

- For `Z = C_{p+}` both sides of the first map vanish: `Z^{C_p} = pt`, and the Tate construction of an induced object is zero.
- For Z = S⁰ with trivial action, the first map is the identity of `T^{tC_p}`.
- Negative control for the unadjusted lax map: for T = 𝕊 and Z = S⁰ the source is `𝕊^∧_p ⊗ 𝕊^∧_p`, whose π₀ is `ℤ_p ⊗ ℤ_p`, uncountable over ℤ_p. The target is 𝕊^∧_p with π₀ = ℤ_p. So the map is a p-adic equivalence and not an equivalence.

### 3.2 The circle-orbit identity

Prove that for every X in `Sp^{BT}` and every m ≥ 1 there are natural equivalences `(X ⊗ (T/C_m)_+)^{hT} ≃ ΣX^{hC_m}`, `(X ⊗ (T/C_m)_+)^{tT} ≃ ΣX^{tC_m}` and `(X ⊗ (T/C_m)_+)_{hT} ≃ X_{hC_m}`. They are compatible with the map induced by `T/C_m → T/C_{m′}` for m | m′, which becomes the transfer `X^{hC_m} → X^{hC_{m′}}`, and with can. This is the circle case of hn-cusp Proposition 3 (line 179), where the adjoint representation of T on the tangent space of T/C_m is trivial of dimension 1. The route uses RefinedTraceMethods §2.4: the fibration `BC_m → BT` has relative dualizing spectrum `S^{−1}`, and `p_!(D ⊗ −) ≃ p_*` on `Sp^{BC_m}`. The Tate statement follows because the fibre of `can` preserves colimits and vanishes on `Σ^∞_+C_m`-induced objects.

*Needs:* RefinedTraceMethods §§2.1, 2.4; AInfCohomology §AI.7.2 (circle Tate construction).

**Checks.**

- For m = 1 and X = Hℤ with trivial action: `(Hℤ ⊗ T_+)^{hT} ≃ ΣHℤ`, with π₁ = ℤ, and the Tate side is 0.
- For X = Hℤ with trivial action and m = p: `π_*((Hℤ ⊗ (T/C_p)_+)^{tT}) = π_{*−1}((Hℤ)^{tC_p})`. This is ℤ/p in every odd degree, following the Tate grading witness of the Conventions.
- The suspension is required: without it the m = 1 homotopy-fixed-point formula would place ℤ in degree 0, which contradicts the free T-action on T_+ (whose homotopy orbits are 𝕊).

### 3.3 Suspension invariance for even E∞-rings

Prove that for every E∞-ring E with `π_{2r+1}E = 0` for all r, and every T-equivariant E-module X (an object of `Fun(BT, Mod_E)`), there is an equivalence of Borel T-spectra `X ⊗ S^V ≃ Σ^{dim_ℝ V}X` for every finite-dimensional complex T-representation V. In particular this holds for every T-equivariant E∞-ring X whose homotopy is concentrated in even degrees, with `E = X^{hT}` (riggenbach-double Proposition 4.2 and Corollary 4.4, lines 296–347). The route classifies E-module local systems on BT with fibre E by maps `BT → BhAut_E(E)`. These are null because `BhAut_E(E)` has homotopy only in odd degrees and BT has cells only in even degrees.

- For a perfectoid ring R, `THH(R;ℤ_p)` is even by Bökstedt periodicity (AInfCohomology §AI.7.2), so every T-equivariant `THH(R;ℤ_p)`-module is suspension invariant. For an 𝔽_p-algebra k, `THH(k)` is a T-equivariant `Hℤ`-module through `Hℤ → Hℤ_p ≃ τ_{≥0}TC(𝔽_p) → THH(𝔽_p) → THH(k)` (hn-cusp line 115; KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.1), and Hℤ is even.
- The equivalence is not natural in V: it is a choice, and only its existence is used.

*Needs:* RefinedTraceMethods §2.1; AInfCohomology §AI.7.2 (Bökstedt periodicity for perfectoid rings); KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.1 (`τ_{≥0}TC(𝔽_p) ≃ Hℤ_p`); EnhancedDerivedSheaves E5 (modules over E∞-rings).

**Checks.**

- For E = Hℤ, `BhAut(Hℤ) ≃ B{±1}` is a K(ℤ/2,1), and maps from the simply connected BT to it are null. This confirms the statement in the simplest case.
- Non-example: E = 𝕊 is not even, and `S^{C(1)} ⊗ 𝕊` is not Borel equivalent to `Σ²𝕊` as a T-spectrum. Its homotopy orbits are the Thom spectrum `(CP^∞)^{C(1)}`, which is not `Σ²Σ^∞_+CP^∞`, because the stable Hopf map η acts nontrivially on its bottom cells.
- For V = C(1) and X = Hℤ with trivial action: `(Hℤ ⊗ S^{C(1)})^{hT} ≃ Σ²Hℤ^{hT}`, which has `π_{2−2j} = ℤ` for all j ≥ 0.

### 3.4 The perfectoid coefficient tower

For a perfectoid ring R with orientation `ker θ = (d)`, write `d̃ = φ(d)` and `d̃_n = φ(d)φ²(d)⋯φ^n(d)`. Prove the following (riggenbach-double Corollary 5.8 and Lemma 5.13, lines 517 and 668; riggenbach-trunc Lemma 4.1, line 575; for perfect 𝔽_p-algebras hn-cusp lines 294–311).

- For n ≥ 0, `π_*(THH(R;ℤ_p)^{hC_{p^n}}) ≅ A_inf(R)[u,v]/(uv − d, d̃_n v)`, with |u| = 2 and |v| = −2. The map from `π_*TC^-(R;ℤ_p) = A_inf(R)[u,v]/(uv − d)` is the quotient map.
- For n ≥ 1, `π_*(THH(R;ℤ_p)^{tC_{p^n}}) ≅ A_inf(R)[v^{±1}]/(d̃_n)`, with `A_inf(R)/d̃_n ≅ W_n(R)` through θ̃_n. The map can sends u to `d v^{−1}` and v to v.
- The transfers `THH(R;ℤ_p)^{hC_{p^{n−1}}} → THH(R;ℤ_p)^{hC_{p^n}}` and `THH(R;ℤ_p)^{tC_{p^{n−1}}} → THH(R;ℤ_p)^{tC_{p^n}}` are Verschiebung maps in even degrees. On the Tate constructions in every even degree, and on the homotopy fixed points in negative even degrees, the transfer is `V : W_{n−1}(R) → W_n(R)`. On the homotopy fixed points in even degrees ≥ 0, where `π_0 = A_inf(R)/(d·d̃_n) ≅ W_{n+1}(R)`, it is `V : W_n(R) → W_{n+1}(R)`. As maps of `A_inf(R)[u,v]/(uv − d)`-modules they are multiplication by `r·d̃_n/d̃_{n−1}` for a unit r.
- The Frobenius `φ^{hC_{p^n}} : THH(R;ℤ_p)^{hC_{p^n}} → THH(R;ℤ_p)^{tC_{p^{n+1}}}` is an isomorphism on π_j for j ≥ 0. The map can is an isomorphism on π_j for j < 0 (riggenbach-double Proposition 5.7, line 507).
- For m = p^n m′ with p ∤ m′, the restriction `THH(R;ℤ_p)^{hC_m} ≃ THH(R;ℤ_p)^{hC_{p^n}}` is an equivalence, and likewise for Tate. The reason is that `BC_{m′}` is p-adically contractible and the action is restricted from T.

For a perfect 𝔽_p-algebra k (d = p, A_inf = W(k)): `π_*THH(k)^{hC_{p^n}} = W(k)[u,v]/(uv − p, p^n v)`, `π_*THH(k)^{tC_{p^n}} = W_n(k)[v^{±1}]`, and the transfer from level n − 1 to level n is multiplication by p (hn-cusp line 309).

*Needs:* AInfCohomology AI.0 and §AI.7.2 (A_inf, θ, perfectoid trace coefficients, `(X^{tT})^∧_p ≃ (X^{tC_p})^{h(T/C_p)}`, the Tate orbit lemma); RefinedTraceMethods §§2.3, 2.9; QWittVectors §1.5 (p-typical Witt vectors); KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.1.

**Checks.**

- For R = 𝔽_p and n = 1: `π_0THH(𝔽_p)^{tC_p} = ℤ_p/p = 𝔽_p = W_1(𝔽_p)`, and `π_{−2}THH(𝔽_p)^{hC_p} = ℤ_p/p·v`. A formula without the relation `d̃_n v` would make `π_{−2}` equal to ℤ_p, the value for TC^-.
- For R = 𝔽_p and n = 2: `π_0THH(𝔽_p)^{tC_{p²}} = ℤ/p² = W_2(𝔽_p)` and `π_0THH(𝔽_p)^{hC_{p²}} = ℤ_p/(p·p²) = ℤ/p³ = W_3(𝔽_p)`. The transfer from n = 1 is multiplication by p in both, which is `V : W_1 → W_2` on the Tate constructions and `V : W_2 → W_3` on the homotopy fixed points. A map sending 1 to 1 would not be a module map from ℤ/p to ℤ/p², and indexing the homotopy fixed points like the Tate constructions would give ℤ/p² instead of ℤ/p³.
- n = 0: `THH(R;ℤ_p)^{hC_1} = THH(R;ℤ_p)`, and `A_inf(R)[u,v]/(uv − d, d̃_0v)` with `d̃_0 = 1` is `A_inf[u]/(d) = R[u]`. This is Bökstedt periodicity.

### 3.5 The staircase lemma

Let `(A_v)_{v≥0}` and `(B_v)_{v≥1}` be abelian groups with maps `φ_v : A_v → B_{v+1}` (v ≥ 0) and `c_v : A_v → B_v` (v ≥ 1). Suppose there is an integer s ≥ 0 such that φ_v is an isomorphism for 0 ≤ v < s, and c_v is an isomorphism for every v ≥ max(s,1). Then the map `δ : ∏_{v≥0}A_v → ∏_{v≥1}B_v`, `δ(x)_v = φ_{v−1}(x_{v−1}) − c_v(x_v)`, is surjective. Its kernel maps isomorphically to `A_{s−1}` by projection if s ≥ 1, and to A_0 if s = 0 (hn-cusp lines 330–349; speirs-axes lines 1025–1046; riggenbach-trunc lines 1266–1272). Applied to the homotopy groups of the factors of a product decomposition `TC^-(m′) = ∏_v X_v^{hT}` and `TP(m′) = ∏_v X_v^{tT}` with homotopy in one parity, it computes TC(m′) in that parity and shows TC(m′) vanishes in the other.

*Needs:* abelian groups and their products (Mathlib `AddCommGroup`, `Pi.addCommGroup`); RefinedTraceMethods §2.9 for the application.

**Checks.**

- s = 0, A_v = B_v = ℤ/p^v (with A_0 = 0), c_v the identity and φ_v arbitrary: δ is bijective and the kernel is A_0 = 0.
- s = 2 with `A_v = W_{v+1}(k)` for v < 2, `A_v = W_v(k)` for v ≥ 2, `B_v = W_v(k)`, φ_v the identity for v < 2 and c_v the identity for v ≥ 2. The kernel is `A_1 = W_2(k)`, which is HN's answer W_s(k) with s = 2.
- Without the isomorphism hypotheses the conclusion fails. For A_v = B_v = ℤ/p and all φ_v and c_v zero, δ = 0, so its kernel is the infinite product `∏_v ℤ/p` and its cokernel `∏_{v≥1} ℤ/p` is nonzero. Neither is a single A_v.

### 3.6 Homotopy of circle cells

For a perfectoid ring R, a complex T-representation λ of complex dimension d, and m = p^n m′ with p ∤ m′, prove `π_j((THH(R;ℤ_p) ⊗ S^λ ∧ (T/C_m)_+)^{hT}) ≅ π_{j−2d−1}(THH(R;ℤ_p)^{hC_{p^n}})` and the same with tT and `tC_{p^n}`. For the Frobenius, consider a finite pointed T-CW complex B of dimension N and a T-map `ψ : B → B′^{C_p}` that is an isomorphism, the restricted Frobenius `THH(R;ℤ_p) ⊗ Σ^∞B → (THH(R;ℤ_p) ⊗ Σ^∞B′)^{tC_p}` is an isomorphism on π_j for j ≥ N, and so is its map of homotopy T-fixed points (speirs-axes Corollary 17, line 603; speirs-trunc Corollary 9, line 377). The inputs are 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. The Frobenius bound uses that φ_p is the connective cover onto `THH(R;ℤ_p)^{tC_p}`, whose `π_{−1}` vanishes.

*Needs:* §§3.1–3.4; Layer 2 §2.3 (Frobenius factorization).

**Checks.**

- For R = 𝔽_p, λ = 0 and m = 1: `π_j((THH(𝔽_p) ⊗ T_+)^{hT}) = π_{j−1}THH(𝔽_p)`, which is 𝔽_p for j odd and j ≥ 1. This is the weight-1 summand of TC^-(𝔽_p[t]).
- For λ = C(1), d = 1 and m = p: π_j of the homotopy fixed points is `π_{j−3}(THH(R;ℤ_p)^{hC_p})`. Forgetting the representation sphere would shift by 1 instead of 3.
- For `B = S^{λ_1} ∧ T_+` (N = 3), the restricted Frobenius is an isomorphism from π_3 on but not on π_1. In π_1 the source is zero, while the target receives `π_{−2}` of a Tate construction, which is nonzero.

### Examples

For a perfect field k and the weight-p^v summands `THH(k) ⊗ (T/C_{p^v})_+` of `THH(k[t])`, in degree 1: `A_v = π_0THH(k)^{hC_{p^v}} = W_{v+1}(k)` and `B_v = W_v(k)`. Here φ is an isomorphism for every v and c is the restriction R. The staircase lemma does not apply, since no finite s exists, and the kernel of φ − can is `lim_R W_{v+1}(k) = W(k) ≠ 0`. So the relative TC of the non-henselian pair `(k[t],(t))` is nonzero in degree 1, although `K_1(k[t],(t)) = 0`. The passage from K to TC needs the birelative or nilpotent hypotheses of Layer 4.

## Layer 4: Normalization squares and birelative theory

### 4.1 Birelative theories

For a map of rings f : A → B and an ideal I ⊂ A mapped isomorphically onto an ideal of B (a Milnor square), define the birelative terms `K(A,B,I)`, `TC(A,B,I)`, `THH(A,B,I)` and `HC(A⊗ℚ,B⊗ℚ,I⊗ℚ)` as total fibres of the evident squares. Use IK for K (hesselholt-axes line 47; speirs-axes line 123).

- There is a natural fibre sequence `K(A,B,I) → K(A,I) → K(B,I)`, and the trace induces `K(A,B,I) → TC(A,B,I)`.
- Functoriality in maps of Milnor squares; for p nilpotent in A, `TC(A,B,I) ≃ TC(A,B,I;ℤ_p)`.

*Needs:* RefinedTraceMethods §4.12 (relative K, TC and K^inv); GeneralAlgebraicKTheory §8.1.

**Checks.**

- For B = A and f the identity, every birelative term vanishes.
- For A = B × C and the ideal B × 0, the square is a product square and the birelative terms vanish, because K and TC preserve finite products.
- For the coordinate axes A_2 → k[x] × k[y], `K_1(A_2,B_2,I_2) = 0` and `K_2(A_2,B_2,I_2) ≅ k` for a field k (Dennis–Krusemeyer, hesselholt-axes line 31). A birelative term that ignored the K₂ failure of excision would give zero in degree 2.

### 4.2 The birelative trace theorem

Prove that for every Milnor square of rings the birelative trace `K(A,B,I) → TC(A,B,I)` is an equivalence, and that rationally `K(A,B,I) ⊗ ℚ ≃ ΣHC(A⊗ℚ,B⊗ℚ,I⊗ℚ)`, with HC over ℚ. This is the specialization of the truncating excision theorem of RefinedTraceMethods §4.18 to `K^inv` and to `KQinf`. Prove also nil-invariance of `K^inv`. If A → A′ is a ring map and J ⊂ A, J′ ⊂ A′ are nilpotent ideals such that A → A′ induces an isomorphism A/J ≅ A′/J′, then `K^inv(A) → K^inv(A′)` is an equivalence (hn-cusp line 97; hesselholt-cusp-polytopes Theorem 4.1, line 839).

*Needs:* §4.1 (birelative terms of a Milnor square); RefinedTraceMethods §§4.12, 4.17, 4.18.

**Checks.**

- For k = 𝔽_p and the axes A_2, `K_2(A_2,B_2,I_2) = 𝔽_p` (Layer 5). On the TC side, the lowest birelative THH summand `Σ^{−1}THH(𝔽_p) ⊗ S^{λ_1} ∧ T_+` has bottom cell in degree 1, and after TC it contributes `W_1(𝔽_p)` in degree 2. A trace that missed the `Σ^{−1}` would put the first nonzero group in degree 3.
- Over ℚ for the coordinate axes A_2: `K_2(A_2,B_2,I_2) ⊗ ℚ ≅ HC_1(A_2,B_2,I_2) = k` (Geller–Reid–Weibel as recalled at hesselholt-axes line 97). A shift by 0 instead of 1 would give `HC_2 = 0` there.
- Non-example: the square of the reduction map f : A = ℤ → B = ℤ/p with I = pℤ and `A/I = B/f(I) = ℤ/p` is not a Milnor square, because f carries I = pℤ to 0 and not isomorphically onto an ideal of B. Its birelative term is the relative term `K(ℤ, pℤ)`, and the birelative trace theorem says nothing about relative K, which is not relative TC (RefinedTraceMethods §4.17 Checks).

### 4.3 The normalization squares of axes and cusps

Prove the following for every ring k.

- *Axes.* For d ≥ 2, `A_d = k[x_1,…,x_d]/(x_ix_j)_{i≠j} → B_d = ∏_i k[x_i]`, with ideal `I_d = (x_1,…,x_d)` and quotient square `k → k^d` (the diagonal), is a Milnor square (speirs-axes line 110).
- *Cusps.* For coprime a, b ≥ 2, the inclusion `A = k[t^a,t^b] ⊂ B = k[t]`, with conductor ideal `c = t^{(a−1)(b−1)}k[t] ⊂ A`, is a Milnor square. The quotients `A/c` and `B/c` are finite k-algebras whose augmentation ideals are nilpotent, so `K^inv(A) ≃ K^inv(B)`. Equivalently the square of K(A), TC(A), K(B) and TC(B) is cartesian (hn-cusp line 89; hesselholt-cusp-polytopes Remark 1.5 and Theorem 4.1, lines 373 and 839).

*Needs:* §§1.1, 4.1–4.2; Mathlib `Polynomial`, `Ideal`.

**Checks.**

- For (a,b) = (2,3), the conductor is `t²k[t]`: t² and t³ lie in A, but t does not. A conductor exponent ab − a − b = 1 would make the inclusion `tk[t] ⊂ A` false.
- For d = 2 and k = ℤ the square is `ℤ[x,y]/(xy) → ℤ[x] × ℤ[y]` over `ℤ → ℤ × ℤ`. It is cartesian as a square of rings, and I_2 maps isomorphically onto `xℤ[x] × yℤ[y]`.
- For the cusp (a,b) = (2,3), `c = t²k[t]` and `A/c = k`, while `B/c = k[t]/t²`. The two quotients are not isomorphic, but both reduce to k modulo a nilpotent ideal. Nil-invariance of `K^inv`, not an isomorphism of the quotients, therefore gives `K^inv(A) ≃ K^inv(B)`.

### 4.4 Relative versus birelative K-theory

Prove the following. If `NK_n(k) = 0` for every integer n, then `K(A_d,I_d) ≃ K(A_d,B_d,I_d)`, and for the cusp `K(A,(x,y)) ≃ fib(IK(A) → IK(k[t]))`. Here `A → A/(x,y) = k` and `A_d → k` are split by the inclusion of constants, so `IK_q(A) = IK_q(k) ⊕ K_q(A,(x,y))`. The hypothesis holds for every regular noetherian ring k (SchemeKTheoryOperations §5.2), and for every ind-smooth ℚ-algebra, because NK commutes with filtered colimits. For a perfect 𝔽_p-algebra it is gap `perfect-homotopy-invariance` (amm-perfectoid Proposition 5.1, line 558; hn-cusp line 101; speirs-axes line 128; hesselholt-axes line 55).

*Needs:* §4.1; SchemeKTheoryOperations §5.2; GeneralAlgebraicKTheory §§10.5, 10.13; gap `perfect-homotopy-invariance` (perfect 𝔽_p-algebras that are not regular noetherian).

**Checks.**

- For k = 𝔽_p[ε]/ε², which is neither regular nor perfect, `NK_1(k) ≠ 0`: the unit `1 + εt` is not constant. So `K(A_2,I_2)` differs from the birelative term there, and the hypothesis is necessary.
- For a perfect field k both cases apply with no gap, since a field is regular noetherian.
- The splitting `IK_q(A) = IK_q(k) ⊕ K_q(A,(x,y))` holds for every k. For the Milnor square it gives `K_0(A_d,I_d) = 0` for a field k: K_0(A_d) = ℤ by Milnor's Mayer–Vietoris sequence, since `K_0(k) ⊕ K_0(B_d) → K_0(k^d)` has kernel ℤ.

### Examples

For a field k and d ≥ 2, Milnor's Mayer–Vietoris sequence gives `K_1(A_d) = k^×`, so `K_1(A_d,I_d) = 0`, and `K_0(A_d,I_d) = 0`. These are the degree-1 and degree-0 values that Layer 5 must reproduce. For the cusp (2,3) over a field, `Pic(A) ≅ k`, which is `K_0(A,(x,y))`. Layer 6 must reproduce it at r = 0.

## Layer 5: Coordinate axes

### 5.1 The birelative TC of the axes in the plane

Prove that for every 𝔽_p-algebra k, with A = k[x,y]/(xy), B = k[x] × k[y] and I = (x,y), there is a natural isomorphism for every integer q, `TC_q(A,B,I;p) ≅ ∏_{d∈J_p} lim_R TR^r_{q−λ_{p^{r−1}d}}(k;p)`. The limit is over r ≥ 1 along the restriction maps of RefinedTraceMethods §2.13 (with `λ_{p^{r−1}d}` restricting to `λ_{p^{r−2}d}` on C_p-fixed points). For every ring k the same holds with ℤ/p^v-coefficients (hesselholt-axes Theorem B, line 70). The limit stabilizes: R is an isomorphism `TR^r_{q−λ_{p^{r−1}d}} → TR^{r−1}_{q−λ_{p^{r−2}d}}` whenever `q < 2p^{r−1}d` (hesselholt-axes Lemma 2.3, line 82). The route goes through the F-equivalence `⋁_{i≥1} Σ^{−1}THH(k) ∧ S^{λ_i} ∧ (T/C_i)_+ ≃ THH(A,B,I)` of genuine T-spectra (hesselholt-axes Proposition 1.2, line 131; §2.5 here for its Borel form). Then group the summands `i = p^{r−1}d` and identify the genuine fixed points of `S^{λ_i} ∧ (T/C_i)_+` with representation-graded TR.

*Needs:* §§2.3, 2.5, 4.1; RefinedTraceMethods §§2.13, 2.16 (genuine TC and the restriction pullback); KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §§4.0, 4.4.

**Checks.**

- For q ≤ 1 every factor vanishes. The reason is that `TR^r_{q−λ}(k;p) = 0` for `q < 2·dim_ℂλ^{C_{p^{r−1}}}`, and `λ_{p^{r−1}d}^{C_{p^{r−1}}}` has complex dimension d ≥ 1. This agrees with `K_q(A,I) = 0` for q ≤ 1 (§§4.4, 5.2).
- For q = 2 only d = 1, r = 1 contributes: `TR^1_{2−λ_1}(k;p) = π_0THH(k) = k`. So `TC_2(A,B,I;p) = k`.
- With λ replaced by 0 the formula would give `∏_d TR_q(k;p)`, which is nonzero in degree 0. This contradicts `K_0(A,I) = 0` (§4.4 Checks).

### 5.2 The axes in the plane over regular noetherian 𝔽_p-algebras

Prove that for every regular noetherian 𝔽_p-algebra k and every integer q, `K_q(k[x,y]/(xy),(x,y)) ≅ ⊕_{m≥1} ⊕_{d∈J_p, d≤m} W_{s(m,d)}Ω^{q−2m}_k`, where `s(m,d)` is the unique s ≥ 1 with `p^{s−1}d ≤ m < p^s d`. This is the p-typical form of `⊕_{m≥1} 𝕎_mΩ^{q−2m}_k` (hesselholt-axes Theorem A and the decomposition at line 36). The route combines §4.4 (NK vanishes for regular noetherian rings), §4.2 (`K(A,B,I) ≃ TC(A,B,I)`, which is p-complete because p = 0 in A), §5.1 and KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.17. In that formula, for `λ = λ_{p^{r−1}d}`, one has `ℓ_s = p^{r−1−s}d` for s ≤ r − 1. So the summand `W_tΩ^{q−2m}_k` occurs for `p^{t−1}d ≤ m < p^t d`, that is, for t = s(m,d), and the limit over r stabilizes to `⊕_{m≥d} W_{s(m,d)}Ω^{q−2m}_k`.

*Needs:* §§1.3, 4.2, 4.4, 5.1; KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.17; CrystallineCohomology CR.4; SchemeKTheoryOperations §5.2.

**Checks.**

- q = 1: every term has q − 2m < 0, so `K_1(A,I) = 0`. This agrees with Milnor's Mayer–Vietoris computation of §4.4.
- q = 2: only m = d = 1, giving `W_1Ω⁰_k = k`. This is the Dennis–Krusemeyer group. q = 3: `Ω¹_k`, which vanishes for perfect k.
- q = 4: `Ω²_k ⊕ W_{s(2,1)}(k) ⊕ W_{s(2,2)}(k)`. For p odd, s(2,1) = s(2,2) = 1, giving `Ω²_k ⊕ k ⊕ k`. For p = 2, d = 2 is excluded and s(2,1) = 2, giving `Ω²_k ⊕ W_2(k)`. For k = 𝔽_2 this is ℤ/4, and a formula with big Witt vectors read componentwise would give `𝔽_2²` (hesselholt-axes line 108).
- Exponent: for `p^{s−1} ≤ n < p^s` and k = 𝔽_p, `K_{2n}(A,I)` has exponent exactly p^s (hesselholt-axes line 110). For n = 2 and p = 2 this is 4.

### 5.3 The axes in affine d-space in positive characteristic

For d ≥ 2 put `A_d = k[x_1,…,x_d]/(x_ix_j)_{i≠j}`, `B_d = ∏_i k[x_i]` and `I_d = (x_1,…,x_d)`. Prove that for every perfect field k of characteristic p > 0 and every r ≥ 0 (speirs-axes Theorems 1–2, lines 27 and 153; Proposition 28 and §5.1, lines 976–1117):

```text
p odd:  K_{2r}(A_d,I_d)   ≅ ∏_{m′∈J_p even} ∏_{s′|m′, s′ even} ∏_{0≤u≤t_ev} W_{t_ev−u}(k)^{⊕cyc_d(p^u s′)}
        K_{2r+1}(A_d,I_d) ≅ ∏_{m′∈J_p odd}  ∏_{s′|m′}         ∏_{0≤u≤t_od} W_{t_od−u}(k)^{⊕cyc_d(p^u s′)}
p = 2:  K_{2r}(A_d,I_d)   ≅ ∏_{m′ odd} ∏_{s′|m′} ∏_{1≤u≤t_ev} W_{t_ev−u}(k)^{⊕cyc_d(2^u s′)}
        K_{2r+1}(A_d,I_d) ≅ ∏_{m′ odd, m′≤2r+1} ∏_{s′|m′} k^{⊕cyc_d(s′)}
```

Here t_ev = t_ev(p,r,m′) and t_od = t_od(p,r,m′) are as in §1.4, and `W_0 = 0`, so each product is finite. The same formulas give `TC_q(A_d,B_d,I_d)` for every perfect field.

The route has three parts. First, `THH(A_d,B_d,I_d)` splits by §2.5 into `THH(k) ⊗ B(m,s)` summands with multiplicity cyc_d(s). Second, Layer 3 computes their TC^- and TP: in the families with m and s of equal parity, the homotopy groups are `W_{v−u+1}(k)` or `W_{v−u}(k)` (speirs-axes Proposition 26, line 857). In the p = 2 family with m even and s odd, they are k in every odd degree, with homotopy fixed points of the v = 0 term equal to k exactly in odd degrees ≥ m′ (speirs-axes Proposition 28). Third, apply the staircase lemma §3.5 with s = t_ev or t_od. In the last family it applies with s = t_od(2,r,m′) and `A_{s−1} = k^{⊕cyc_d(s′)}`, giving one copy for each odd m′ ≤ 2r + 1.

speirs-axes Theorem 2 prints the p = 2 odd-degree formula with the index 0 ≤ v ≤ t_ev, and that version is false; the count above is the correct one. The printed version fails in degree 1: for d = 3 and r = 0 it would give a nonzero group from m′ = 3, while `K_1(A_d,I_d) = 0` by §4.4.

*Needs:* §§1.4, 2.5, 3.1–3.6, 4.2, 4.4; KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.1.

**Checks.**

- d = 2: only cyc_2(2) = 1 is nonzero. For p odd, `K_{2r} = ∏_{m′ = 2d′, d′∈J_p} W_{t_ev}(k)` with `p^{t−1}·2d′ ≤ 2r < p^t·2d′`, that is t = s(r,d′), and the odd groups vanish. For p = 2, u = 1 and s′ = 1 give `∏_{m′ odd} W_{t_ev−1}(k)` with t_ev − 1 = s(r,m′), and the odd groups vanish because cyc_2 of an odd number is 0. Both agree with §5.2 for a perfect field.
- d = 3, q = 3: for p = 2, m′ = 3 gives `k^{cyc_3(3)} = k²`. For p = 3, m′ = 1, u = 1 gives `W_1(k)^{cyc_3(3)} = k²`. For p = 5, m′ = 3, u = 0 gives k². All primes agree with each other and with the char-0 count c_2(3) = 2 of §5.4.
- d = 3, q = 5: p = 2 gives `k^{cyc_3(3)} ⊕ k^{cyc_3(5)} = k^8`, and p = 3 gives `W_1(k)^{cyc_3(3)} ⊕ W_1(k)^{cyc_3(5)} = k^8`. The printed index 0 ≤ v ≤ t_ev would give two copies of k² for m′ = 3, since t_ev(2,2,3) = 1, and a copy of `k^{cyc_3(s′)}` for every odd m′ > 5, an infinite product.
- d = 3, q = 2: for p odd, m′ = 2 and u = 0 give `k^{cyc_3(2)} = k³ = k^{d(d−1)/2}`, the Dennis–Krusemeyer rank.

### 5.4 The axes in affine d-space in characteristic zero

Prove that for every commutative ℚ-algebra k, every d ≥ 2 and q ≥ 1 there is an isomorphism (speirs-axes Theorem 30, line 1163):

```text
HC_q((A_d,I_d)/ℚ) ≅ ⊕_{m≥2 even} ⊕_{s|m even} HH_{q+1−m}(k/ℚ)^{⊕cyc_d(s)}
                  ⊕ ⊕_{m≥3 odd}  ⊕_{s|m odd}  HH_{q+1−m}(k/ℚ)^{⊕cyc_d(s)}
                  ⊕ ⊕_{i≥1} HH_q(k/ℚ)^{⊕d}
```

The last summand is the relative HC of the d lines and disappears in the birelative term. Prove further that for every ind-smooth ℚ-algebra k, `K_q(A_d,I_d) ≅ ⊕_{j=0}^{q−2} (Ω^j_{k/ℚ})^{⊕c_{d−1}(q−j)}` (speirs-axes Theorem 31, line 1228).

The route: §2.4 identifies `HH(A_d/ℚ)` with `HH(k/ℚ) ⊗ B^cy(Π_d)`. Over ℚ, the words with s odd and i even have no rational homology (§2.5), and `(HH(k) ⊗ S^{λ_j} ∧ (T/C_i)_+)_{hT}` has homotopy `HH_{q−2j}(k)` because rational group homology of C_i is concentrated in degree 0. Then §4.2 gives `K_q(A_d,B_d,I_d) ≃ HC_{q−1}(A_d,B_d,I_d)`, which is rational because the birelative K-groups are ℚ-vector spaces. §4.4 applies since NK vanishes for ind-smooth ℚ-algebras, and the smooth HKR theorem of RefinedTraceMethods §1.9 identifies `HH_j(k/ℚ) ≅ Ω^j_{k/ℚ}`, extended to filtered colimits.

*Needs:* §§1.4, 2.4–2.5, 4.2, 4.4; RefinedTraceMethods §§1.4, 1.9, 4.17–4.18.

**Checks.**

- d = 2: `c_1(m) = 1` for m even, so `K_q(A_2,I_2) ≅ ⊕_{m≥1} Ω^{q−2m}_{k/ℚ}` (hesselholt-axes line 100). For k = ℚ and q = 4 this is ℚ, while a perfect field of characteristic p > 2 gives k ⊕ k (§5.2), so the two characteristics differ from degree 4 on.
- q = 2, k algebraic over ℚ: `K_2 = k^{c_{d−1}(2)} = k^{d(d−1)/2}`, the same count as §5.3.
- For k = ℚ(t), q = 3 and d = 2: `K_3 = Ω¹_{ℚ(t)/ℚ} = ℚ(t)dt ≠ 0`. A formula using only `k^{c(q)}` would give 0.

### Examples

For k = 𝔽_3 and d = 2, the groups `K_q(A_2,I_2)` for q = 1, …, 6 are 0, 𝔽_3, 0, 𝔽_3², 0, ℤ/9 ⊕ 𝔽_3. In degree 6, m = 3 and d ∈ {1,2} prime to 3 give `W_{s(3,1)}(𝔽_3) = W_2(𝔽_3) = ℤ/9` and `W_{s(3,2)}(𝔽_3) = 𝔽_3`. The exponent 9 = 3² is the one §5.2 predicts for 3 ≤ n = 3 < 9.

## Layer 6: Planar cuspidal curves

### 6.1 TC of the cusp relative to its normalization

Prove that for every perfect 𝔽_p-algebra k and coprime a, b ≥ 2, with A = k[x,y]/(y^a − x^b) and B = k[t], the fibre F of TC(A) → TC(B) satisfies `π_{2r}F ≅ ∏_{m′∈J_p} W_{h(a,b,r,p,m′)}(k)` for r ≥ 0, with every other homotopy group zero. The index h is that of §1.3, for a labelling with p ∤ b (hn-cusp §2, lines 216–393).

The route: by §2.6, `cofib(THH(A) → THH(B)) ≃ ∏_{m≥1} THH(k) ⊗ Σ^∞B_m`, and THH(k) is a T-equivariant Hℤ-module (§3.3). So `THH(k) ⊗ B_m` is the total cofibre of the square of `THH(k) ⊗ (T/C_{m/c})_+[2ℓ(a,b,m)]`. By §3.2 and §3.4 its homotopy fixed points and Tate construction are cofibres of transfer maps `THH(k)^{hC_{p^{v−u}}} → THH(k)^{hC_{p^v}}`, each multiplication by p^u. The Frobenius carries weight m to weight pm and is an isomorphism in the relevant degrees (§3.1, using the free-cell cofibre of §2.6, and §3.6). The staircase lemma (§3.5), applied for each m′ ∈ J_p in each of the three cases (neither a′ nor b divides m′, a′ but not b divides m′, b divides m′), gives `W_h(k)` in degree 2r + 1 of the cofibre, and zero otherwise.

*Needs:* §§1.1, 1.3, 2.6, 3.1–3.6, 4.3; KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.1.

**Checks.**

- (a,b,r) = (2,3,0), p = 2: the product is `W_1(k)` from m′ = 1, so `π_0F = k`. For k = 𝔽_2 this is 𝔽_2, of length 1 = ½·1·1·2.
- (2,3,1) and k = 𝔽_5: here `T(2,3,1) = {1,5,7}`, so m′ = 1 has `h = s_T(1) = 2` and m′ = 7 has h = 1, giving `ℤ/25 ⊕ 𝔽_5`. For k = 𝔽_3, the three indices 1, 5, 7 each give h = 1, so the answer is `𝔽_3³`. Both have length 3 = ½·3·1·2.
- Odd vanishing: F has no odd homotopy groups. A computation that kept the even TC^- groups would produce classes in odd degrees of F from the Tate side.

### 6.2 K-theory of planar cuspidal curves

Prove that for every perfect 𝔽_p-algebra k and coprime a, b ≥ 2, `K_j(k[x,y]/(y^a − x^b),(x,y)) ≅ W_S(k)/(V_aW_{S/a}(k) + V_bW_{S/b}(k))` for j = 2r ≥ 0 with S = S(a,b,r), and that all other relative K-groups vanish (hn-cusp Theorem A, line 27). The isomorphism is canonical, and the right-hand side is identified with `W_{T(a,b,r)}(k)` by §1.2. The route: §4.3 gives `fib(IK(A) → IK(B)) ≃ F`, and §4.4 identifies the left side with `K(A,(x,y))`. For perfect fields, and more generally regular noetherian perfect k, this uses SchemeKTheoryOperations §5.2; for other perfect 𝔽_p-algebras it uses gap `perfect-homotopy-invariance`. Then §6.1 computes F, and §§1.2–1.3 with gap `bigwitt-ptypical-decomposition` identify `∏_{m′} W_h(k) ≅ W_{T(a,b,r)}(k)`.

*Needs:* §§1.2–1.3, 4.3–4.4, 6.1; SchemeKTheoryOperations §5.2; gaps `perfect-homotopy-invariance` and `bigwitt-ptypical-decomposition`.

**Checks.**

- r = 0: `K_0(A,(x,y))` has length `(a−1)(b−1)/2` over W(k), the δ-invariant of the cusp (hn-cusp line 37). For (a,b) = (2,3) and a perfect field k this is `W_{{1}}(k) = k`, the unipotent Picard group `(k[t]/t²)^×/k^× ≅ k` of the conductor square.
- For every r, the length is `½(2r+1)(a−1)(b−1)` by Sylvester's count (§1.1). For (2,5) and r = 0 this is 2, and `T(2,5,0) = {1,3}`. For k = 𝔽_3 this gives `W_{{1,3}}(𝔽_3) = W_2(𝔽_3) = ℤ/9`, cyclic, while a componentwise reading would give `𝔽_3²`.
- Negative degrees: `K_{−1}(A,(x,y)) = 0` for every perfect field, because F has no negative homotopy (§6.1) and `NK_{−1}(k) = 0`. The theorem therefore excludes negative K-groups, which a nonconnective statement over a singular base k would have to track.

### Examples

For (a,b) = (2,3) and k = 𝔽_2, the relative K-groups are `K_0 = 𝔽_2`, `K_2 = W_{{1,5,7}}(𝔽_2) = 𝔽_2³` and `K_4 = W_{T(2,3,2)}(𝔽_2)` with `T(2,3,2) = {1,5,7,11,13}`, so `K_4 = 𝔽_2^5`. The odd groups vanish. Over k = 𝔽_5 the 5-adic index set changes: in degree 4, `T(2,3,2) ∩ J_5 = {1,7,11,13}` with `s_T(1) = #{1,5} = 2`, giving `ℤ/25 ⊕ 𝔽_5³`, again of length 5.

## Layer 7: Truncated polynomial algebras over perfectoid rings

### 7.1 TC^- and TP of truncated polynomial algebras

Prove that for every perfectoid ring R and e ≥ 1 there is an equivalence `TC^-(R[x]/x^e,(x);ℤ_p) ≃ ∏_{n≥1, e∤n} Σ^{2⌊(n−1)/e⌋+1}THH(R;ℤ_p)^{hC_{p^{v_p(n)}}} × ∏_{k≥1} Σ^{2(k−1)+1}cofib(V_{e,k})`. Here `V_{e,k} : THH(R;ℤ_p)^{hC_{p^{v_p(k)}}} → THH(R;ℤ_p)^{hC_{p^{v_p(ek)}}}` is the transfer induced by `T/C_k → T/C_{ek}`, and the second product runs over the weights n = ek. The analogous statement holds for TP, with Tate constructions (riggenbach-trunc Lemma 5.2, line 889). Under these equivalences the Frobenius carries weight n into weight pn. The route uses §2.6 (KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.16's cofibre sequences), the product decomposition of §2.3, §3.2 and §3.3.

*Needs:* §§2.3, 2.6, 3.2–3.4; KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.16.

**Checks.**

- e = 1: the first product is empty, and each `V_{1,k}` is the identity map, so both sides vanish.
- R = 𝔽_p, e = 2, n = 1: the factor is `(ΣTHH(𝔽_p))^{hC_1} = ΣTHH(𝔽_p)`, with π_1 = 𝔽_p. This is the class of x in the relative `TC^-_1`.
- For e = p and k = 1, `V_{p,1}` is the transfer `THH^{hC_1} → THH^{hC_p}`. For R = 𝔽_p it is multiplication by p from ℤ/p to ℤ/p² in degree 0, so its cofibre has π_0 = ℤ/p. Treating the e | n weights like the others would lose this cofibre.

### 7.2 The p-adic K-theory of truncated polynomial algebras

Prove that for every perfectoid ring R, every e ≥ 1 and r ≥ 1, `K_{2r−1}(R[x]/x^e,(x);ℤ_p) ≅ W_{re}(R)/V_eW_r(R)`, with big Witt vectors on {1,…,n}, and that `K_j(R[x]/x^e,(x);ℤ_p) = 0` for every even j (riggenbach-trunc Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 6.5, lines 67 and 1279).

The route: DGM (RefinedTraceMethods §4.17) identifies the relative p-adic K-theory with relative TC, because (x) is nilpotent. §7.1 and §3.4 give the homotopy groups of each factor, in odd degrees only. For each u ∈ J_p, the staircase lemma (§3.5) applies to the weights p^v u with `s = s(p,re,u)`, the unique s with `up^{s−1} ≤ re < up^s`, or 0 if none exists. It yields `W_s(R)` if e′ ∤ u and `W_{min(s,v_p(e))}(R)` if e′ | u, where `e = p^{v_p(e)}e′` (riggenbach-trunc lines 74–99). That index is `s_{T_{r,e}}(u)` for `T_{r,e} = {m ≤ re : e ∤ m}`. Finally §1.2 and gap `bigwitt-ptypical-decomposition` identify `∏_u W_{s_T(u)}(R) ≅ W_{T_{r,e}}(R) ≅ W_{re}(R)/V_eW_r(R)`.

Prove also the syntomic form: for every perfect 𝔽_p-algebra k and i ≥ 1, the reduced syntomic complex `ℤ̃_p(i)(k[x]/x^e) = fib(ℤ_p(i)(k[x]/x^e) → ℤ_p(i)(k))` is `(W_{ei}(k)/V_eW_i(k))[−1]` (sulyma-slopes Theorem 1.1, line 43). Its route: the crystalline comparison (PrismaticCohomologyPartII §4.23) and the PD de Rham model of `Δ_{k[x]/x^e}` with Nygaard filtration the product of the PD-Hodge and p-adic filtrations (PrismaticCohomologyPartII §§3.19, 3.24; CrystallineCohomology CR.2), followed by the explicit diagonalization by monomial degree (sulyma-slopes §3, lines 232–330).

*Needs:* §§1.2–1.3, 3.4–3.5, 7.1; RefinedTraceMethods §4.17; PrismaticCohomologyPartII §§3.19, 3.24, 4.23; PrismaticCohomologyPartIII §7.0; CrystallineCohomology CR.2; gap `bigwitt-ptypical-decomposition`.

**Checks.**

- e = 1: `W_r(R)/V_1W_r(R) = 0`, as for `R[x]/x = R`.
- R a perfect field: the group is `𝕎_{re}(k)/V_e𝕎_r(k)` of KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.17, transported by the big Witt comparison of KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.16a. For R = 𝔽_2, e = 2 and r = 1 it is ℤ/2, the principal units `1 + x𝔽_2[x]/x²`. For R = 𝔽_3, e = 2 and r = 2: `T_{2,2} = {1,3}` and the group is `W_2(𝔽_3) = ℤ/9`, not `𝔽_3²`.
- Mixed characteristic: for `R = O_C` (the ring of integers of the completed algebraic closure of ℚ_p), e = 2 and r = 1, the group is `W_{{1}}(O_C) = O_C`. This agrees with relative K_1, the p-completed principal units `1 + xO_C`, which are additively O_C through `1 + ax ↦ a`.

### Examples

For R = 𝔽_p and e = 2 the odd groups are `K_{2r−1}(𝔽_p[x]/x²,(x)) ≅ W_{T_{r,2}}(𝔽_p)` with `T_{r,2}` the odd numbers ≤ 2r. For p odd this is `∏_{u odd, p∤u, u≤2r} W_{s}(𝔽_p)` with s the number of j ≥ 0 such that `up^j ≤ 2r`. For r = 1 it is 𝔽_p, the relative K_1. For R = 𝔽_p and e = p, r = 1, `T_{1,p} = {1,…,p−1}` and `K_1 = 𝔽_p^{p−1}`, which is `(1 + x𝔽_p[x]/x^p)^×`, of order `p^{p−1}`.

## Layer 8: Prismatic and syntomic cohomology relative to δ-rings and of filtered rings

This layer builds the prismatic package of a commutative algebra over an arbitrary δ-ring, its syntomic complexes and its filtered variant, with crystalline degeneration. It generalizes the relative prismatic cohomology over a prism (PrismaticCohomology Layers 1–2) and the absolute theory (PrismaticCohomologyPartII Layer 4), and agrees with both. Locators refer to akn-delta v2. akn24 cites the v1 numbering: its "Theorem 1.1", "Corollary 1.2", "Corollary 10.32", "Proposition 10.41" and "Proposition 10.44, Corollary 10.45" are v2's Theorem 1.2, Corollary 1.3, Corollary 10.34, Proposition 10.43, and Proposition 10.46 with Corollary 10.47.

### 8.1 δ-pairs

Define a δ-pair as a δ-ring A with a map of commutative rings A → R. It is bounded if A and R have bounded p^∞-torsion. It is finitely presented free if A is the free δ-ring on finitely many generators and R is a polynomial A-algebra in finitely many variables. It is relatively quasisyntomic if R is derived p-complete and `L_{R/A}` has p-complete Tor-amplitude in [0,1]. It is relatively quasiregular semiperfectoid if, in addition, it admits a pre-prismatic factorization `A → A′ → R` with A → A′ p-completely relatively perfect, `A′ → R` surjective and `L_{R/A′}` of p-complete Tor-amplitude in [1,1] (akn-delta line 121 and Definitions 9.1–9.2, lines 1838–1850). Maps of δ-pairs are commuting squares with a δ-map on the first entry.

- The bounded δ-pairs form a category Pairs_δ, with base change along δ-maps A → A′ and products.
- Prisms (A,I) with A-algebras R, and the pairs (ℤ_p, R) and (W(k), R) for perfect 𝔽_p-algebras k, are bounded δ-pairs. Relatively qrsp pairs form a basis of the relatively quasisyntomic pairs for the quasisyntomic topology (akn-delta Proposition 9.14, line 1974).
- The sequence `W(k)⟦z_0⟧ → W(k)⟦z_0,z_1⟧ → ⋯`, the p-complete Amitsur complex of `W(k) → W(k)⟨z_0⟩` with each term completed along the augmentation ideal of `z_i ↦ 0`, and with every δ(z_i) = 0, is a cosimplicial δ-ring. It maps to `O_K/ϖ^n` by z_i ↦ ϖ (akn24 lines 501–507).

*Needs:* PrismaticCohomology §§0.55–0.56 (free δ-rings, limits and colimits), §§0.73–0.76 (prisms, Breuil–Kisin prisms); DerivedDeRhamCohomology Layer 5 (cotangent complex and Tor-amplitude conditions, quasisyntomic sites).

**Checks.**

- `W(k)⟦z⟧` with δ(z) = 0 is a δ-ring, the Breuil–Kisin base. Its map to `O_K` sending z to ϖ makes `(W(k)⟦z⟧, O_K)` a bounded, relatively quasisyntomic δ-pair: `L_{O_K/W(k)⟦z⟧}` is `(E(z))/(E(z))²[1]`.
- Non-example: 𝔽_p carries no δ-structure. From p = 0 one gets `δ(0) = δ(p) = 1 − p^{p−1} = 1` in 𝔽_p, while δ(0) = 0. So (𝔽_p, 𝔽_p) is not a δ-pair, and characteristic-p rings enter only as the second entry.
- `(ℤ_p, ℤ/p^n)` is bounded and relatively quasisyntomic: `L_{(ℤ/p^n)/ℤ_p} = (p^n)/(p^{2n})[1]` has Tor-amplitude in [0,1] after p-completion. `(ℤ_p, ℚ_p)` is a δ-pair but not relatively quasisyntomic, because the derived p-completion of ℚ_p is 0 ≠ ℚ_p.

### 8.2 Prismatic packages and their syntomic complexes

For a bounded δ-ring A, define the ∞-category C_A of prismatic packages. Its objects are quadruples (H, N, c, φ): H is a p-complete and complete filtered graded E∞-A-algebra (the Hodge–Tate tower); N is a p-complete and complete filtered graded E∞-A-algebra whose filtration is constant in nonpositive filtration degrees, so that it is indexed by `(ℕ,≥) × ℤ` (the Nygaard-completed Frobenius twist); c is a φ_A-semilinear map `H → sc_p(N)` of `(ℕ,≥) × ℤ`-filtered graded A-modules; and φ is a map of filtered graded algebras from N to the shearing `sh(H)`, which lowers the filtration degree by the grading degree (akn-delta Definition 8.1, line 1701; Definition 1.1, line 89, states c without its filtration). Here `sc_p(N)` is, in each grading, the Day convolution of the rescaled filtration `N^{≥p·⋆}` with the p-adic filtration `p^⋆ℤ` (akn-delta Construction 7.3, line 1557): its m-th piece is assembled from the terms `N^{≥pa} ⊗ p^bℤ` with a + b = m, its 0-th piece is `N^{≥0}`, and modulo p it maps canonically to `N^{≥p·⋆}/p`, the terms with b ≥ 1 going to zero (akn-delta lines 1689–1699). So c restricts to `H^{≥0} → N^{≥0}`, and modulo p it induces `H^{≥m}/p → N^{≥pm}/p` for every m ≥ 0. For i ∈ ℤ, define the syntomic complex `ℤ_p(i)(H,N,c,φ) = fib(can − cφ : N^{≥i}{i} → N^{≥0}{i})`, where cφ is φ into `sh(H)^{≥i}{i} = H^{≥0}{i}` followed by c (akn-delta Definition 8.4, line 1753).

- C_A has all colimits, and taking associated graded pieces preserves them (akn-delta Proposition 8.3, line 1745).
- *Finite-stage formula.* Let i ≥ 0 and (p−1)j > pi, equivalently p(j−i) > j. Modulo p, let `cφ : N^{≥j}{i}/p → N^{≥j−i}{i}/p` be φ into `H^{≥j−i}{i}/p`, then the map `H^{≥j−i}{i}/p → N^{≥p(j−i)}{i}/p` induced by c, then can. It exists only modulo p: the axioms give no integral map `N^{≥j} → N^{≥j−i}`, and followed by can into `N^{≥0}{i}/p` it is the reduction of the integral cφ. Then `can − cφ : N^{≥j}{i}/p → N^{≥j−i}{i}/p` factors, canonically and functorially, as an automorphism of `N^{≥j}{i}/p` followed by `can : N^{≥j}{i}/p → N^{≥j−i}{i}/p`. The reason is that cφ lifts through `N^{≥p(j−i)} → N^{≥j}`, and the identity minus a map that raises the complete filtration is invertible (akn-delta Lemma 8.5 and its proof, lines 1759–1769). The map need not be an equivalence: it is zero on the absolute package of 𝔽_2 at i = 1, j = 3. Hence `𝔽_p(i)(H,N,c,φ) ≃ fib(can − cφ : (N^{≥i}{i}/N^{≥j}{i})/p → (N^{≥0}{i}/N^{≥j}{i})/p)`, where the map on the quotients is the one induced by the comparison square below. The route compares the square with top row the automorphism of `N^{≥j}{i}/p`, right column `can : N^{≥j}{i}/p → N^{≥0}{i}/p`, and bottom row `can − cφ` mod p: the top fibre is zero, so passing to vertical cofibres does not change the horizontal fibre. This is akn-delta Proposition 8.6 (line 1770) with the strict bound (p−1)j > pi of Lemma 8.5 in place of its printed bound (p−1)j ≥ i, which fails in the Checks below.
- Let G_A be the ∞-category of quadruples (H, N, c, φ) as above with H and N only p-complete and complete filtered graded A-modules and φ a map of filtered graded A-modules (akn-delta Definition 8.1, line 1701), so that C_A is the ∞-category of E∞-algebras in G_A (line 1714). The syntomic complexes `ℤ_p(i)` and `𝔽_p(i)`, defined by the same formula on G_A, preserve all limits and all colimits as functors from G_A to `D(ℤ)^∧_p` (akn-delta Corollary 8.7, line 1787). On C_A they preserve all limits and all sifted colimits. The reason is that C_A is the pullback of the ∞-categories of E∞-algebras in the vertices of the pullback defining G_A (akn-delta lines 1714–1717); in each vertex limits and sifted colimits of E∞-algebras are computed underlying (lurie-ha Corollaries 3.2.2.5 and 3.2.3.2), because the completed Day convolution preserves colimits in each variable. They do not preserve all colimits of C_A: its initial object is the unit package (akn-delta Remark 8.2(ii), line 1723), which is not sent to 0. Sifted colimits are what the left Kan extension of §8.4 uses.

*Needs:* EnhancedDerivedSheaves E5 (filtered and graded objects, E∞-algebras, completions); PrismaticCohomologyPartII §§3.9–3.10 (Breuil–Kisin twists and divided Frobenius), §3.20 (Nygaard completion).

**Checks.**

- For A = R = ℤ_p in weight 0: `Δ̂_{ℤ_p} = ℤ_p` with φ = id and `N^{≥0}` everything, so `ℤ_p(0)(ℤ_p) = fib(0 : ℤ_p → ℤ_p) = ℤ_p ⊕ ℤ_p[−1]`. This matches `H^*_ét(Spec ℤ_p; ℤ_p)`. A definition using can alone would give `fib(id) = 0`.
- For the absolute package of 𝔽_2 (`Δ̂ = ℤ_2`, `N^{≥n} = 2^nℤ_2`, `cφ = φ/2`) and i = 1, the map `can − cφ` sends 2a to a, so `ℤ_2(1)(𝔽_2) = 0`, as it must be since `𝔽_2^×` is trivial. With j = 3 (so (p−1)j = 3 > pi = 2), `can : N^{≥3}/2 → N^{≥2}/2` is zero (`8b ∈ 2·4ℤ_2`). The mod-p cφ factors through `can : N^{≥4}/2 → N^{≥2}/2`, which is also zero, so `can − cφ = 0 = can ∘ id` there. The top row of the comparison square is an automorphism with zero fibre, and the finite-stage formula gives 0 again. The naive reduction of the integral divided Frobenius `8ℤ_2 → 4ℤ_2`, `8b ↦ 4b`, is nonzero in `N^{≥2}/2 = 4ℤ_2/8ℤ_2` for b odd, and no automorphism α makes `can ∘ α = 0` equal to it. So the factorization needs the filtered structure of c, and fails for a package whose c is only a map `H^{≥0} → N^{≥0}`. With j = 1, allowed by the printed bound (p−1)j ≥ i, it gives `fib(0 → (ℤ_2/2ℤ_2) ⊗^L 𝔽_2) = 𝔽_2 ⊕ 𝔽_2[−1] ≠ 0`.
- For the Breuil–Kisin pair `(ℤ_2⟦z⟧, ℤ_2)` with z ↦ 2, E(z) = z − 2, p = 2 and i = 1, `ℤ_2(1) = fib(E·ℤ_2⟦z⟧ → ℤ_2⟦z⟧, fE ↦ fE − φ(f))` (akn24 line 2337, with p − 1 = 1), which modulo 2 is `fz ↦ fz + f²` on `k⟦z⟧`, k = 𝔽_2. Directly: H⁰ = k (from f = z) and H¹ = k², since the image is cut out by b₀ = b₁ and b₂ = 0. The formula with j = 3 has source `⟨z, z²⟩`, target `k⟦z⟧/z³`, and sends z ↦ 1 + z, z² ↦ 0, so H⁰ = k and H¹ = k², as it must. With j = 2, allowed by the printed bound but not by (p−1)j > pi, the source `⟨z⟩` maps injectively into `k⟦z⟧/z²`, giving H⁰ = 0 and H¹ = k, which is wrong. A target quotient by `N^{≥j−i}` instead of `N^{≥j}` gives, for j = 3, the map `⟨z, z²⟩ → k⟦z⟧/z²` with H⁰ = k and H¹ = k, also wrong.
- For the zero object of G_A (all objects zero), every syntomic complex is zero, as preservation of the empty colimit requires; the zero package is also the terminal object of C_A, consistent with preservation of the empty limit. The unit package of `C_{ℤ_p}` (the trivial filtration on ℤ_p in weight 0, c the canonical map, φ = id) is initial in `C_{ℤ_p}`, and `ℤ_p(0)` sends it to `fib(id − id = 0 : ℤ_p → ℤ_p) = ℤ_p ⊕ ℤ_p[−1] ≠ 0`. So the syntomic functors do not preserve all colimits on C_A, only the sifted ones.

### 8.3 Prismatic cohomology relative to a δ-ring

Construct, functorially in bounded δ-pairs (A, R), the prismatic package `Δ_{R/A} = (Δ^{[⋆]}_{R/A}{⋆}, N^{≥⋆}Δ̂^{(1)}_{R/A}{⋆}, c, φ) ∈ C_A`, whose c is a natural φ-semilinear multiplicative filtered map `Δ^{[⋆]}_{R/A}{⋆} → sc_p(N^{≥⋆}Δ̂^{(1)}_{R/A}{⋆})`. On transversal oriented prisms it refines the semilinear map to the Nygaard completion, because `φ_A(d) = d^p + pδ(d)` lies in filtration 1 of the target (akn-delta Lemma 7.5, line 1579). Here `Δ^{[n]}_{R/A}{i}` is the global sections over WCart of the prismatic crystal whose value on a transversal prism (B,J) is the derived relative prismatic cohomology `Δ^{rel,[n]}_{R⊗̂B/A⊗̂B}{i}` (akn-delta §1.2, lines 184–197). Prove the properties of akn-delta Theorem 1.2 (line 126):

1. Insensitivity to localization at elements of A invertible in R, and to derived (p,K)-completion of A for a finitely generated K ⊆ ker(A → R) and derived p-completion of R.
2. If A is a prism, `Δ_{R/A}` is Bhatt–Scholze's derived relative prismatic cohomology.
3. For A = ℤ_p, or A = W(k) with k a perfect 𝔽_p-algebra, it is the absolute prismatic cohomology of PrismaticCohomologyPartII §4.18, and the Frobenius twist is equivalent to `Δ_{R/A}`.
4. Left Kan extension from finitely presented free δ-pairs.
5. p-completely quasisyntomic descent in R for fixed A.
6. p-completely quasismooth descent in A for fixed R.
7. Base change: for every δ-map A → A′, `Δ_{R/A} ⊗_A A′ → Δ_{R⊗_AA′/A′}` is an equivalence after completing for the Hodge–Tate filtration, and likewise for the Nygaard-completed term.
8. Invariance under p-adically relatively perfect maps A → A′.

The functor is uniquely determined by (4), (6) and the following agreement property, and alternatively by (4), (5) and it: on relatively quasiregular semiperfectoid pairs (A, R) with a chosen prism `(A′, I)` of a pre-prismatic factorization, `Δ_{R/A}` agrees, naturally in the choice, with Bhatt–Scholze's derived prismatic cohomology `Δ_{R/A′}` (akn-delta line 1991 and Proposition 9.15, line 2010). Prove the δ-conjugate filtration: the Hodge–Tate cohomology `Δ̄_{R/A}{i}` (the weight-zero piece `Δ^{[0]}_{R/A}{i}/Δ^{[1]}_{R/A}{i}` of the Hodge–Tate tower) has an exhaustive increasing filtration with `gr_u ≃ LΩ^u_{R/A} ⊗ fib(i − u : ℤ_p → ℤ_p)[−u]` (akn-delta Proposition 1.6 = Proposition 3.9, line 200). Prove that when `L_{R/A}` has p-complete Tor-amplitude in [0,1], `Δ_{R/A}` is computed by the relative prismatic site (akn-delta Theorem 1.7(1), line 211).

*Needs:* §§8.1–8.2; PrismaticCohomology §§1.2–1.4 and 2.1–2.13 (relative and derived prismatic cohomology, prismatic envelopes); PrismaticCohomologyPartII §§4.4–4.10 (WCart, its points, fibre products and prismatic crystals), §4.17 (relative prismatic complexes of animated rings), §§4.18–4.19, §4.22 (diffracted Hodge complex), §§4.25, 4.29, 4.31 (absolute Nygaard filtration and Frobenius); DerivedDeRhamCohomology Layer 5.

**Checks.**

- For A = R = ℤ_p and i = 0, only u = 0 occurs, and `gr_0 = fib(0 : ℤ_p → ℤ_p) = ℤ_p ⊕ ℤ_p[−1]`. This is the absolute Hodge–Tate cohomology of ℤ_p, on which the Sen operator acts by 0 in weight 0. A filtration with graded pieces `LΩ^u[−u]` alone would give ℤ_p, the Hodge–Tate cohomology relative to a prism, not the absolute one.
- For A = W(k)⟦z⟧ and R = O_K, property (2) applies to the Breuil–Kisin prism `(W(k)⟦z⟧, E(z))`, and `Δ_{O_K/W(k)⟦z⟧} = W(k)⟦z⟧` because O_K is the reduction modulo E(z).
- Property (8): `ℤ_p → W(𝔽_q)` is relatively perfect, so `Δ_{R/ℤ_p} ≃ Δ_{R/W(𝔽_q)}` for every `W(𝔽_q)`-algebra R. This is the identification `Δ_{R/ℤ_p} ≃ Δ_{R/W(k)}` used for `O_K/ϖ^n` (akn24 line 498).

### 8.4 Relative syntomic complexes

Define the relative syntomic complexes `ℤ_p(i)(R/A) = fib(can − cφ : N^{≥i}Δ̂^{(1)}_{R/A}{i} → Δ̂^{(1)}_{R/A}{i})` for i ∈ ℤ (akn-delta Definition 7.8, line 1599). Prove the following.

- They satisfy descent along maps of pairs `(A,R) → (B,S)` with R → S of universal descent, with no condition on A → B (akn-delta Corollary 1.3 = Corollary 7.10, line 1607).
- They are left Kan extended from finitely presented free δ-pairs (akn-delta Corollary 1.4 = Corollary 8.9, line 1812).
- They vanish for i < 0 (akn-delta Corollary 8.10, line 1824).
- For A = ℤ_p they are the syntomic complexes of PrismaticCohomologyPartIII §6.8 (akn-delta Remark 7.9, line 1604).

*Needs:* §§8.2–8.3; PrismaticCohomologyPartIII §§6.8–6.9, 6.31.

**Checks.**

- `ℤ_p(1)(R/ℤ_p)` is the derived p-completion of `G_m(R)[−1]` for local R. For R = ℤ/4 its H¹ is `(ℤ/4)^× = ℤ/2`.
- For i = −1 the complex vanishes, while the Breuil–Kisin twisted prismatic cohomology `Δ_R{−1}` does not. The vanishing comes from the Nygaard condition, not from the twist.
- For A = W(k)⟦z_0⟧ and R = O_K, `ℤ_p(p−1)(O_K/A)` is `fib(W(k)⟦z_0⟧·d^{p−1} → W(k)⟦z_0⟧)`, with `f·d^{p−1} ↦ f d^{p−1} − φ(f)` for d = E(z_0) (akn24 Proposition 4.24, line 1399, and line 2337). The map is not zero, so a version using can alone would give the wrong H⁰.

### 8.5 Filtered prismatic cohomology

Define the following (akn-delta Definitions 10.2–10.10, lines 2105–2136). A filtered abelian group is strict if each `F^mM → F^{m_0}M` is injective. A filtered δ-ring is a strict filtered commutative ring F^⋆A with a δ-structure on A = F^0A, compatible with the filtration in the sense that δ carries `F^m` into `F^{pm}`. A filtered prism is a filtered δ-ring F^⋆A with a prism structure (A, I) on A = F^0A such that each graded piece `gr^iA` is `I ⊗_A gr^0A`-torsion free and `I ⊗_A gr^0A`-complete; then `(gr^0A, I ⊗_A gr^0A)` is a prism. For a filtered δ-ring with a prism structure this holds if and only if the flat filtration `A/I ⊗_A F^⋆A` on A/I (akn-delta Definition 10.8) is strict (akn-delta Definition 10.6 and Remark 10.9, lines 2116–2135). A filtered δ-pair is a filtered δ-ring with a map of filtered rings to F^⋆R. Construct the filtered prismatic package `F^⋆Δ_{R/A}` by descent along `Spf Rees(F^⋆A) → F Spf A`, and the filtered syntomic complexes `F^{≥⋆}ℤ_p(i)(R/A)` (akn-delta Definition 10.29 and Construction 10.44, lines 2301 and 2530). Prove the following.

- For relatively quasisyntomic filtered δ-pairs, base change gives `F^⋆Δ_{R/A}` at the generic fibre and the graded package `Δ_{gr R/gr A}` at the special fibre. Hence `gr^⋆ℤ_p(i)(F^⋆R/F^⋆A) ≃ gr^⋆ℤ_p(i)(gr^⋆R/gr^⋆A)` and `F^0ℤ_p(i)(F^⋆R/F^⋆A) ≃ ℤ_p(i)(F^0R/F^0A)` (akn-delta Proposition 10.46 and Corollary 10.47, lines 2583–2591).
- The filtered Hodge–Tate comparison (akn-delta Proposition 10.37, line 2415) and the filtered base-change square (akn-delta Proposition 10.31 and Corollary 10.34, lines 2309 and 2386).
- *Filtered envelopes.* For an oriented filtered prism (F^⋆A,(d)) and a filtered Koszul-regular sequence (d, x_1, …, x_c), the filtered prismatic envelope `F^⋆A{x_1/d, …, x_c/d}^∧` is a filtered prism representing the final object of the filtered relative prismatic site, and `F^⋆Δ_{R/A}` is equivalent to it (akn-delta Proposition 10.43, line 2489). In particular it is discrete.

*Needs:* §§8.1–8.4; PrismaticCohomology §0.93 and §2.13 (envelopes over orientable prisms); EnhancedDerivedSheaves E5 (filtered objects and Rees constructions).

**Checks.**

- For the trivial filtration (F^m = 0 for m > 0), the filtered package is constant and `gr^⋆` is concentrated in weight 0. A filtered theory that ignored the base filtration would differ already for `W(k)⟦z⟧` with z in weight 1.
- For F^⋆ the z-adic filtration on `W(k)⟦z⟧` and R = k⟦z⟧, the associated graded pair is `(W(k)[z], k[z])`, graded with z of weight 1. Corollary 10.47 identifies `gr ℤ_p(i)` with the graded syntomic complexes of `k[z]` over `W(k)[z]`.
- The filtered Breuil–Kisin prism: `W(k)⟦z⟧` with the z-adic filtration and I = (E(z)) has `gr^uA ≅ W(k)·z^u` for u ≥ 0 and `I ⊗_A gr^0A = (p) ⊆ W(k)`; each `W(k)` is p-torsion free and p-complete, so it is a filtered prism (akn-delta Example 10.7, lines 2121–2124). For the trivial filtration on a prism (A, I) the condition reduces to A being I-torsion free and I-complete, which is part of being a prism, so the graded conditions carry content only in positive weights; there, by Remark 10.9, they amount to strictness of the flat filtration on A/I, which a filtered δ-ring with a prism structure need not have.
- A filtered δ-ring must have `δ(F^m) ⊆ F^{pm}`, not merely F^m. For z of weight 1, `δ(z) = 0` is allowed, while `δ(z) = 1` is not, since 1 has weight 0 < p.

### 8.6 Crystalline degeneration and completeness

Prove crystalline degeneration (akn24 Proposition 2.6, line 325). Let F^⋆R and F^⋆S be filtered rings that are quasisyntomic in the filtered sense: their p-completed Rees algebras are quasisyntomic over the p-completed Rees algebra of the trivially filtered ℤ_p. An equivalence `gr^⋆R ≃ gr^⋆S` of associated graded rings induces equivalences `gr^⋆_FΔ_R ≃ gr^⋆_FΔ_S` and `gr^⋆_Fℤ_p(i)(R) ≃ gr^⋆_Fℤ_p(i)(S)` for every i. This is §8.5 with A = ℤ_p trivially filtered.

Prove completeness (akn24 Proposition 2.11 and Lemma 2.12, lines 357 and 381). If F^⋆R is a complete filtered ring that is the filtered quotient of the completion of a finitely generated filtered polynomial ring by a filtered regular sequence, then the F-adic filtration on ℤ_p(i)(R) is complete. The route uses the finite-stage formula (§8.2), the conjugate filtration of absolute Hodge–Tate cohomology through the diffracted Hodge complex (PrismaticCohomologyPartII §4.22), and completeness of the derived forms `LΩ^j_{R/ℤ_p}`.

Prove the comparison of completions (akn24 Theorem 2.20, line 457). For a filtered prismatic δ-pair: (1) if F^⋆R is complete and `L_{R/A}` is a perfect filtered R-module, the Nygaard completion of `Δ^{(1)}_{R/A}` is F-complete; (2) if `gr^0R` is smooth over `gr^0A`, the F-completion is Nygaard-complete.

*Needs:* §§8.2–8.5; PrismaticCohomologyPartII §§4.22, 4.29; DerivedDeRhamCohomology Layer 2 (derived de Rham and its Hodge pieces).

**Checks.**

- `O_K/ϖ^n` with the ϖ-adic filtration and `𝔽_q[z]/z^n` with the z-adic filtration have the same associated graded `𝔽_q[z]/z^n`. Degeneration therefore identifies `gr_Fℤ_p(i)(O_K/ϖ^n)` with `gr_Fℤ_p(i)(𝔽_q[z]/z^n)`, although `ℤ_p(i)(ℤ/p²) ≇ ℤ_p(i)(𝔽_p[z]/z²)` in general. For i = 1 both have H¹ of order p, but `K_3` differs: `K_3(ℤ/4;ℤ_2) = ℤ/8` while `K_3(𝔽_2[z]/z²;ℤ_2)` is `W_4(𝔽_2)/V_2W_2(𝔽_2) = W_{{1,3}}(𝔽_2) = 𝔽_2²` by §7.2.
- Completeness needs a complete filtered ring. Syntomic complexes are formed on p-complete rings (PrismaticCohomologyPartIII §6.8), so take `ℤ_p⟨z⟩` with the z-adic filtration, which is separated but not complete. The F-adic filtration on `ℤ_p(1)(ℤ_p⟨z⟩)` is not complete. Its completion has the same graded pieces as `ℤ_p(1)(ℤ_p⟦z⟧)`, whose H¹ contains the p-completed principal units `1 + zℤ_p⟦z⟧`, in particular 1 + z. In contrast `H¹(ℤ_p(1)(ℤ_p⟨z⟩))` is the p-completion of `ℤ_p⟨z⟩^× = {Σ a_n z^n : a_0 ∈ ℤ_p^×, a_n ∈ pℤ_p for n ≥ 1, a_n → 0}`, which contains 1 + pz but not 1 + z.
- For `R = O_K/ϖ^n` with the ϖ-adic filtration, R is the quotient of `W(k)⟦z⟧` (complete, z of weight 1) by the filtered regular sequence `(E(z), z^n)`, so completeness applies. Combined with §9.2 it reduces ℤ_p(i)(R) to the finitely many weights 1 ≤ j ≤ in − 1.

### Examples

For R = ℤ/p^n over the Breuil–Kisin pair (ℤ_p⟦z⟧, z ↦ p), the relative prismatic cohomology `Δ_{R/ℤ_p⟦z⟧}` is the prismatic envelope `ℤ_p⟦z⟧{z^n/E(z)}^∧` with E(z) = z − p. Its filtered version is discrete with an explicit W(k)-basis (Layer 9, §9.5).

## Layer 9: K-theory of finite chain rings

Throughout, `R = O_K/ϖ^n` is a finite chain ring with invariants (p, e, f, n), q = p^f and `j = ⌈n/e⌉` (Conventions). Every quotient of O_K by a nonzero proper ideal has this form, and `ℤ/p^n = ℤ_p/p^n` is the case e = f = 1.

### 9.1 Reduction to syntomic cohomology

Prove the following.

- `K(R;ℤ[1/p]) → K(𝔽_q;ℤ[1/p])` is an equivalence (akn24 Corollary 2.3, line 279). The route: for every prime ℓ ≠ p, the pair (R, ϖR) is henselian with ℓ invertible, so Gabber rigidity gives `K(R)/ℓ ≃ K(𝔽_q)/ℓ` (KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §2.1). Rationally, `K(R,ϖR) ⊗ ℚ ≃ ΣHC(R ⊗ ℚ, ϖR ⊗ ℚ) = 0` because `R ⊗ ℚ = 0` (RefinedTraceMethods §4.17, Goodwillie). Hence the relative term is p-primary torsion with vanishing mod-ℓ reductions.
- `K_r(R;ℤ_p) → TC_r(R)` is an isomorphism for r ≥ 0 (akn24 Corollary 2.5, line 295). This follows from DGM for the nilpotent ideal ϖR (RefinedTraceMethods §4.17), together with the fact that `K(𝔽_q;ℤ_p) → TC(𝔽_q)` is (−2)-truncated (KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §§1.1–1.6 and 5.1).
- `gr^i TC(R;ℤ_p) ≃ ℤ_p(i)(R)[2i]` for the motivic filtration (PrismaticCohomologyPartIII §7.0).

*Needs:* RefinedTraceMethods §4.17; KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §§1.1–1.6, 2.1, 5.1; PrismaticCohomologyPartIII §7.0.

**Checks.**

- n = 1: R = 𝔽_q, and every statement reduces to Quillen's `K_{2i−1}(𝔽_q) = ℤ/(q^i − 1)`, `K_{2i}(𝔽_q) = 0`. In particular `K_{2i−1}(𝔽_q;ℤ_p) = 0`, since p ∤ q^i − 1.
- `K_1(ℤ/4) = (ℤ/4)^× = ℤ/2`, which is 2-primary, while `K_1(𝔽_2) = 0`. The prime-to-2 parts agree, as the first statement requires.
- Degree −1: `TC_{−1}(𝔽_q) = ℤ_p ≠ 0` while `K_{−1}(𝔽_q) = 0`. So the second statement is limited to r ≥ 0.

### 9.2 Bounded syntomic cohomology of finite chain rings

Prove the following for i ≥ 1, with the ϖ-adic filtration F on R.

- For `R_0 = 𝔽_q[z]/z^n` with its z-adic filtration, `Δ̂_{R_0}` and its Nygaard filtration are computed by the p-completed divided-power de Rham complex of `W(𝔽_q)[z]` along (z^n), with the product of the PD-Hodge and p-adic filtrations, compatibly with the grading (akn24 Lemma 2.8, line 344). For j ≥ 1, `gr^j_FΔ̂_{R_0} ≅ W(𝔽_q)/{j,n}[−1]` and `gr^j_FN^{≥i}Δ̂_{R_0} ≅ W(𝔽_q)/p^{ε(i,j)}{j,n}[−1]`. Here {j,n} is n if n | j and j otherwise, and ε is the function of §1.5 (akn24 line 437; sulyma-slopes §3).
- `gr^j_Fℤ_p(i)(R)` lies in cohomological degrees [1,2] and vanishes for j = 0 and for j ≥ in. The F-adic filtration on ℤ_p(i)(R) is complete. Hence `ℤ_p(i)(R) ≃ F^{[1,in−1]}ℤ_p(i)(R)`, concentrated in cohomological degrees 1 and 2 (akn24 Corollaries 2.13–2.14, lines 388–399).
- `K_{2i−1}(R;ℤ_p) ≅ H¹(ℤ_p(i)(R))` for i ≥ 1, and `K_{2i−2}(R;ℤ_p) ≅ H²(ℤ_p(i)(R))` for i ≥ 2. The motivic spectral sequence degenerates and has no extensions, for degree reasons (akn24 Corollary 2.16, line 408).
- Every `K_r(R)` with r ≥ 1 is finite. Its prime-to-p part is that of K_r(𝔽_q) by §9.1. Its p-adic part is finite because H¹ and H² of a complex of finitely generated ℤ_p-modules with torsion cohomology are finite. A p-primary torsion group whose derived p-completion has finite homotopy in every degree has no divisible part, since a divisible part would contribute a nonzero Tate module one degree up.

*Needs:* §§1.5, 7.2, 8.6, 9.1; PrismaticCohomologyPartII §§3.19, 3.24, 4.23; CrystallineCohomology CR.2; PrismaticCohomologyPartIII §7.0.

**Checks.**

- n = 1, i = 1: the window [1, in − 1] = [1, 0] is empty, so ℤ_p(1)(𝔽_q) = 0. Indeed `𝔽_q^×` is prime to p.
- R = ℤ/4, i = 1: H¹ = ℤ/2 = K_1(ℤ/4;ℤ_2), and H² = 0, consistent with `K_0(ℤ/4;ℤ_2) = ℤ_2` being carried by weight 0. A window [0, in − 1] would include `gr^0`, which is ℤ_2(1)(𝔽_2) = 0 here but nonzero in weight 0.
- The table values of akn24 (line 144) satisfy the finiteness statement: `K_3(ℤ/8) = ℤ/3 ⊕ ℤ/4 ⊕ ℤ/8` and `K_5(ℤ/8) = ℤ/7 ⊕ ℤ/2 ⊕ ℤ/2^6`. The prime-to-2 parts ℤ/3 = K_3(𝔽_2) and ℤ/7 = K_5(𝔽_2) are as §9.1 requires.

### 9.3 Angeltveit's quotient

Prove that for i ≥ 1, `|H¹(ℤ_p(i)(R))| / |H²(ℤ_p(i)(R))| = q^{i(n−1)}`. Hence `|K_{2i−1}(R;ℤ_p)| / |K_{2i−2}(R;ℤ_p)| = q^{i(n−1)}` for i ≥ 2 (akn24 Proposition 2.18 and Proposition 1.5, lines 419 and 162). The route: by §9.2 the Euler characteristic of `ℤ_p(i)(R) = fib(can − φ : F^{[1,in−1]}N^{≥i}Δ̂_R{i} → F^{[1,in−1]}Δ̂_R{i})` is computed on F-graded pieces. By crystalline degeneration (§8.6) these are the pieces of `𝔽_q[z]/z^n`, whose orders differ by `q^{ε(i,j)}`. The count of §1.5 gives `Σ_j ε(i,j) = i(n−1)`.

*Needs:* §§1.5, 8.6, 9.2.

**Checks.**

- ℤ/4, i = 2: `|K_3(ℤ/4;ℤ_2)| = 8` and `|K_2(ℤ/4)| = 2`, ratio `4 = 2^{2·1}` (akn24 line 144).
- ℤ/8, i = 2: `|K_3(ℤ/8;ℤ_2)| = 4·8 = 32` and `|K_2(ℤ/8)| = 2`, ratio `16 = 2^{2·2}`. For i = 3: `|K_5(ℤ/8;ℤ_2)| = 2·64 = 128` and `|K_4(ℤ/8)| = 2`, ratio `64 = 2^{3·2}`.
- `𝔽_2[z]/z³` (n = 3), i = 3: `|K_5;ℤ_2| = 4·16 = 64` and `K_4 = 0`, ratio `64 = 2^{3·2}`. A ratio `q^{in}` would give 2^9.

### 9.4 Relative-to-absolute descent and the finite free model

Let `A^• = W(k)⟦z_0⟧ ⇉ W(k)⟦z_0,z_1⟧ ⋯` be the completed Amitsur complex of §8.1, filtered with every z_i of weight 1 and δ(z_i) = 0, mapping to R by z_i ↦ ϖ. Prove the following.

- *Descent.* The maps `F^{≥⋆}Δ_{R/W(k)}{i} → Tot F^{≥⋆}Δ_{R/A^•}{i}`, the analogous map for `F^{≥⋆}N^{≥j}Δ̂^{(1)}{i}`, and `F^{[a,b]}ℤ_p(i)(R) → Tot F^{[a,b]}ℤ_p(i)(R/A^•)` (for i ≥ 1) are equivalences (akn24 Theorem 2.22, line 515).
- *Discreteness and bases.* Each `F^{≥⋆}Δ_{R/A^s}`, `F^{≥⋆}N^{≥i}Δ̂^{(1)}_{R/A^s}` and `F^{≥⋆}Δ̂^{(1)}_{R/A^s}` is discrete (akn24 Proposition 2.23, line 532). For [a,b] ⊂ ℤ the pieces `F^{[a,b]}` are finite free W(k)-modules. Explicit monomial bases in the δ-powers δ^u(a) and δ^u(b_v), resp. the classes `d̃^j z_0^k ∏ f_u^{e_u} ∏ g_{u,v}^{e_{u,v}}`, have exponents below p and the stated weight constraints (akn24 Propositions 2.24, 3.33 and 3.34, lines 537, 1037 and 1070). The input is the presentation of the δ-ideal `(da − r)_δ` by `da − r` and `δ^u(a)^p − (−p + d^{p^{u+1}}λ_u)δ^{u+1}(a) − R_u`, with units λ_u (akn24 Lemma 3.6, line 670), and its Nygaard-graded analogue (akn24 Proposition 3.30 and Corollary 3.31, lines 984 and 1008).
- *Breuil–Kisin orientations.* A prism is orientable if and only if it admits a Breuil–Kisin orientation `s : B → B{1}`. Crystalline prisms have a crystalline orientation, and complete filtered-crystalline prisms are orientable (akn24 Lemmas 4.6, 4.7, 4.10 and 4.13–4.15, lines 1204–1306). With an orientation, the relative syntomic complexes of R over A^s are computed with trivialized twists (akn24 Proposition 4.24, line 1399).
- *Finite model.* For i ≥ 1, `ℤ_p(i)(R)` is the total fibre of the square formed by `can − φ` on `F^{[1,in−1]}N^{≥i}Δ̂^{(1)}_{R/A^0}{i}` and on the kernel of `d_0 − d_1 + d_2` on the level-1 term (akn24 Theorem 2.27, line 576). Equivalently, by the connection `∇` of the Hopf algebroid `(Δ̂_{R/A^0}, Δ̂_{R/A^1})`, it is the total fibre of `can − φ` and `can − φ^∇` between `∇`-sources and `∇`-targets (akn24 Lemma 4.43 and Corollary 4.44, lines 1644 and 1664). Consequently `ℤ_p(i)(R)` is quasi-isomorphic to a three-term complex `ℤ_p^{f(in−1)} → ℤ_p^{2f(in−1)} → ℤ_p^{f(in−1)}` of finite free ℤ_p-modules in cohomological degrees 0, 1, 2, with injective first differential (akn24 Theorem 1.1, line 108, structurally).

*Needs:* §§8.1–8.6, 9.2; PrismaticCohomology §§0.73–0.76, 0.93, 2.13; PrismaticCohomologyPartII §§3.6, 3.9.

**Checks.**

- n = 1 (R = 𝔽_q), i = 1: f(in − 1) = 0, so the model is zero, matching ℤ_p(1)(𝔽_q) = 0.
- ℤ/4, i = 1: f(in − 1) = 1, so the model is `ℤ_2 → ℤ_2² → ℤ_2` with injective first map. Its H¹ ⊕ H² has total order 2, consistent with H¹ = ℤ/2, H² = 0 and Angeltveit's quotient `2 = 2^{1·1}`.
- The basis condition "exponents < p" is essential. At p = 2, `δ(a)` already satisfies `a² = (−2 + d²λ_0)δ(a) + R_0`, so allowing a² as a basis element would double-count weight 2.

### 9.5 The even vanishing theorem

Prove that if i ≥ 2 and `i − 1 ≥ B(p,e,n)`, with B the threshold of §1.5, then `K_{2i−2}(R) = 0` (integrally) and `K_{2i−1}(R)` has order `(q^i − 1)·q^{i(n−1)}` (akn24 Theorem 5.2, Corollary 5.6 and Theorem 1.4, lines 2074, 2091 and 156). The route is as follows.

1. Nilpotency modulo p in the relative envelope over `W(k)⟦z_0⟧`: certain `d̃`-powers and `f_u` become nilpotent mod p in prescribed Nygaard levels, and for u ≥ j, `f_u^p` agrees with `p f_{u+1}` up to a unit (akn24 Lemmas 5.7–5.9 and Corollary 5.10, lines 2105–2157).
2. A prismatic Cartier isomorphism: the Frobenius twist identifies the ∇-rows of the descent model (akn24 Theorem 5.12, Lemma 5.15, lines 2169 and 2197).
3. Divisibility of can by p under the threshold, so that can − φ is surjective in cohomological degree 2 (akn24 Lemma 5.16, line 2219).

The integral statement uses §9.1 for the prime-to-p part, and the order statement uses §9.3 and `|K_{2i−1}(𝔽_q)| = q^i − 1`.

*Needs:* §§1.5, 9.1, 9.3, 9.4; KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §§1.1–1.6.

**Checks.**

- n ≤ e (so R ≅ 𝔽_q[z]/z^n): j = 1 and B = p²n/((p−1)e). Since `𝔽_q[z]/z^n = O_K/ϖ^n` for K with arbitrarily large e, the theorem gives `K_{2i−2}(𝔽_q[z]/z^n) = 0` for every i ≥ 2 (akn24 Corollary 5.5, line 2084). This agrees with KTheoryFiniteLocalFields §5.17 and §7.2 here, where the even relative groups vanish.
- ℤ/4: B = 12, so `K_{2i−2}(ℤ/4) = 0` for i ≥ 13, and `|K_{2i−1}(ℤ/4)| = (2^i − 1)2^i` there. The table shows the stronger fact that `K_2(ℤ/4) = ℤ/2` is the only nonzero even group, and `|K_5(ℤ/4)| = 56 = 7·8` (akn24 Example 1.7, line 172).
- The weaker bound `p²(p^j − 1)/(p−1)²` of akn24 Remark 5.4 does not give the characteristic-p case: for j = 1 it is p²/(p−1) ≥ 4 independently of e, so it never covers i = 2. The exact threshold is therefore part of the statement.

### 9.6 Nilpotence of v₁

Prove that the class `v₁ ∈ H⁰(𝔽_p(p−1)(ℤ_p))` acts on `⊕_{i∈ℤ} 𝔽_p(i)(R)` with nilpotence degree at most `[j]_p`, with equality if e | n. For `ℤ/p^n` the degree is exactly `[n]_p = (p^n − 1)/(p − 1)` (akn24 Theorem 6.3 and Theorem 1.8, lines 2330 and 197). The route: locate v₁ in `H⁰(𝔽_p(p−1)(O_K/A^0))` through the relative-to-absolute descent sequence. Using the oriented description `ℤ_p(p−1)(O_K/A^0) = fib(W(k)⟦z_0⟧·d^{p−1} → W(k)⟦z_0⟧)` of §8.4, identify v₁ with the class `v = d^p` up to a unit. For n ≥ 2, prove `v^{[j]_p} = 0` in `N^{≥[j]_p(p−1)}Δ̂^{(1)}_{R/W(k)⟦z⟧}/p`, and `v^{[j]_p−1} ≠ 0` when e | n (akn24 Proposition 6.2, line 2321). For n = 1 the statement is the first Check below.

*Needs:* §§8.4, 9.4, 9.5 (Lemmas 5.7–5.9); PrismaticCohomologyPartIII §7.0 (multiplicative motivic filtration).

**Checks.**

- n = 1: [1]_p = 1, so v₁ acts by zero on `⊕_i 𝔽_p(i)(𝔽_q)`, which is concentrated in weight 0, where `𝔽_p(0)(𝔽_q) = 𝔽_p ⊕ 𝔽_p[−1]`, and v₁ shifts weight by p − 1. This is consistent: v₁ maps to zero in `𝔽_p(p−1)(𝔽_q) = 0`.
- ℤ/4: [2]_2 = 3, so v₁³ acts by zero and v₁² does not. Here e = 1 divides n = 2, so equality holds.
- For K with e = 2 and n = 3: j = 2, so the bound is [2]_p = p + 1, but e ∤ n, so only the inequality is asserted. Claiming equality there would go beyond akn24 Remark 1.10 (line 206).

### Examples

For ℤ/4: K_1 = ℤ/2, K_2 = ℤ/2, K_3 = ℤ/3 ⊕ ℤ/8, K_4 = 0, K_5 = ℤ/7 ⊕ ℤ/8 (akn24 line 144). Angeltveit's quotient at i = 2 is 8/2 = 4 = 2², and the order formula `(2^i − 1)2^i` at i = 3 gives 56. For `𝔽_2[z]/z³`, `K_3 = ℤ/3 ⊕ ℤ/2 ⊕ ℤ/8` and `K_4 = 0`; the 2-part of K_3 is `W_6(𝔽_2)/V_3W_2(𝔽_2) = W_{{1,2,4,5}}(𝔽_2)`. By §7.2 and the 2-typical decomposition (d = 1: {1,2,4}, d = 5: {5}) this is `W_3(𝔽_2) ⊕ W_1(𝔽_2) = ℤ/8 ⊕ ℤ/2`, as in the table. Likewise `K_1 = W_{{1,2}}(𝔽_2) = ℤ/4` and the 2-part of K_5 is `W_{{1,2,4,5,7,8}}(𝔽_2) = ℤ/16 ⊕ ℤ/2 ⊕ ℤ/2`, both matching akn24 line 144.

## Downstream consumers

No existing roadmap cites these calculations. The intended consumers are the following.

- A roadmap on non-A¹-invariant motivic cohomology of singular schemes, whose motivic refinements of the coordinate axes, cusps and truncated polynomials are bouis-motivic §§2–3. It would use Layers 5–7 as the weight-graded targets of its motivic spectral sequences.
- The p-adic K-theory of `O_K` through continuity: `K(O_K;ℤ_p) ≃ lim_n K(O_K/ϖ^n;ℤ_p)` (RefinedTraceMethods §4.18) together with Layer 9 gives the finite-level groups whose limit is KTheoryFiniteLocalFields Layer 6.
