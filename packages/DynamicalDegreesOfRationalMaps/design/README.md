# Roadmap: dynamical degrees of rational maps

**Summary.** This roadmap builds the degree theory of dominant rational maps between projective varieties over an arbitrary field. Starting from Mathlib's rational maps and scheme-theoretic images and Tau Ceti's function-field maps of dominant morphisms, it constructs the graph `Γ_f ⊆ X ×_K Y` of a dominant rational map with its two projections, the pullback of function fields and the topological degree `e(f) = [K(X) : f^*K(Y)]`, which counts inseparable degree. Intersection numbers are the Euler-characteristic numbers of proper schemes over a field. Over an arbitrary field, with nefness and Kleiman's nonnegativity theorem imported, the roadmap proves the positivity package the degrees need: Siu's inequality, the Hodge inequality on possibly singular surfaces, the Khovanskii–Teissier inequalities, and Siu's inequality for products, for nef line bundles and for all nef real classes, the latter by approximation with ample line bundles. With these it defines the degrees `deg_k(f; L, M) = (π_1^*L^{d−k} · π_2^*M^k)_{Γ_f}`. It proves they do not depend on the birational model of the graph, that they are positive, that `deg_0` and `deg_d` are `(L^d)` and `e(f)·(M^d)`, and that they are invariant under normalization and under extension of the ground field. Its main estimate is sub-multiplicativity along chains `X_1 ⤏ X_2 ⤏ X_3` of dominant maps between varieties of the same dimension, with constant `(d−k+1)^k/(L_2^d)`. From this follow the comparison of polarizations and birational conjugacy. The end theorems are existence of the dynamical degrees `λ_k(f) = lim deg_{k,ω}(f^n)^{1/n}`, equal to `inf_n (C·deg_{k,ω}(f^n))^{1/n}`. They lie in `[1, ∞)` and do not depend on the real polarization ω, a nef real class with `(ω^d) > 0`. They satisfy `λ_k(f^n) = λ_k(f)^n`, `λ_0 = 1`, `λ_d = e(f)` and log-concavity, and are invariant under birational conjugacy and extension of the field. The algebraic entropy is `h_alg(f) = log max_k λ_k(f)`. The examples on projective space are degrees of maps given by forms, morphisms, Silverman's first dynamical degree, the standard Cremona involution (where `deg(σ²) = 1 < d²`), the Fibonacci map with `λ_1` the golden ratio, Frobenius, and polynomial self-maps of affine space.

## Scope and ownership

This roadmap owns the following.

- The pullback of function fields along a dominant rational map, the topological degree and its multiplicativity (§1.1). Mathlib has the bijection between rational maps and morphisms from the spectrum of the function field. Tau Ceti has the function-field map of a dominant morphism (`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldMap`, `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldAlgHom`) and, for integral sources whose local rings are valuation rings, the morphism attached to a map of function fields (TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/Birational/AlgHom.lean). Neither library has the pullback along a dominant rational map or its degree; §1.1 builds them on the morphism case. Tau Ceti's `TauCeti.Isogeny.fieldPullback` (TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Isogeny/FunctionField.lean:167) covers only isogenies of Weierstrass elliptic curves, on their algebraic function fields.
- The graph of a rational map between projective varieties, its projections as a modification and an alteration, the correspondence attached to a composite, and the normalization and field-extension behaviour of graphs (§§1.2–1.4).
- The component formula for Euler-characteristic intersection numbers, their comparison with Chow-theoretic degrees, their real multilinear extension, and the reduction of homogeneous inequalities to integral varieties over algebraically closed fields (Layer 2).
- Over an arbitrary field: the reading of the imported nefness and Kleiman nonnegativity in Euler-characteristic intersection numbers, on arbitrary closed subschemes and for all nef real classes, with the approximation of nef real classes on a projective scheme by positive rational multiples of ample line bundles (§§3.1–3.2); Siu's inequality in intersection form, the Hodge inequality on possibly singular projective surfaces, the Khovanskii–Teissier inequalities and Siu's inequality for products (§§3.3–3.6).
- Degrees of dominant rational maps, their basic values and invariances, sub-multiplicativity, comparison of polarizations and birational conjugacy (Layer 4); dynamical degrees and algebraic entropy (Layer 5); the projective-space and affine-space theory of Layer 6.

The following are imported, not planned again.

- Euler-characteristic intersection numbers on proper schemes over a field, with Snapper polynomiality, symmetry, additivity, the projection formula with the function-field degree, the Cartier-divisor restriction formula, positivity for ample line bundles and compatibility with extension of the field: CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3.
- The real numerical space `N¹(X/K) = Num(X/K) ⊗ ℝ` of a proper `K`-scheme with its class map from `Pic(X)`: AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.1, over the base `Spec K`. Nefness of line bundles and of classes of `N¹(X/K)` (nonnegative degree on every integral curve), the nef cone `Nef(X/K)`, stability under sums, positive scaling and pullback, and preservation under extension of the ground field: its §1.5. Kleiman's nonnegativity theorem for nef line bundles on integral closed subschemes, ampleness of a nef line bundle plus an ample one, and ampleness of `mL + E` for ample `L`, any line bundle `E` and all large `m`, over every field: its §1.7. The length-weighted component law for curve degrees: AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §0.1. On a projective variety this nefness is the geometric nefness of ArakelovGeometryAndAbelianHeightsPartII §0.1. Volume, bigness, the Hilbert–Samuel formula `vol(L) = (L^d)` for nef `L`, and Siu's inequality `vol(L − M) ≥ (L^d) − d(L^{d−1}·M)` for nef `L, M`: ArakelovGeometryAndAbelianHeightsPartII §0.3.
- Bertini irreducibility for the generic linear section: LefschetzPencilsAndVanishingCycles §5.1.
- Chow groups, proper pushforward, first Chern classes, the projection formula, modifications, alterations, de Jong's alteration theorem, regularity and smoothness over perfect fields, projective space and its twisting sheaves, normal schemes and finiteness of normalization, descent along field extensions, coherent cohomology on proper schemes, Chow's lemma, and, on smooth projective surfaces, the Hodge index theorem for a line bundle of positive self-intersection and Riemann–Roch: SchemeAndStackFoundations §§0.3, 0.7, 0.11, 0.20, 0.30, 2.6, 3.3, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.16, 4.19, 5.1–5.3 and 5.10.
- Ampleness is Tau Ceti's `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.LineBundleClass.IsAmple`. Very ampleness, and very ampleness of the high powers of an ample line bundle: AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry §1.4. Projective morphisms, tensor powers, pullback and global generation of line bundles: StableReduction Layer 2.
- Flat base change of scheme-theoretic images: for a quasi-compact morphism of locally Noetherian schemes, the scheme-theoretic image of its base change along a flat morphism of locally Noetherian schemes is the inverse image of its scheme-theoretic image. This is the scheme case of the schematic image of AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry §5.4, which for schemes is Mathlib's `Scheme.Hom.image`; §1.4 uses it for extension of the ground field.
- Rational self-maps of `ℙ¹` as classes of pairs of binary forms with multiplicative degree, and their identification with endomorphisms of the scheme `ℙ¹`: ArithmeticDynamics §§0.18 and 0.26, used in a Check of §6.2.

What is left out, as motivation for later roadmaps:

- Numerical cycle spaces `N^k(X)_ℝ` in codimension `k ≥ 2`, their finite-dimensionality, the pullback operators `f^* = π_{1*}π_2^*` on all `N^k(X)_ℝ` and the spectral description `λ_k(f) = lim ‖(f^n)^*‖^{1/n}` (dang2020 Theorem 2; truong2020 Theorem 1.1(5)). The same Part treats relative dynamical degrees and the product formula (dang2020 Theorem 4; truong2020 Theorem 1.1(4)). This is DynamicalDegreesOfRationalMaps, Part II. Codimension one is imported: real classes here are elements of `Pic(X) ⊗ ℝ`, nef when their image in `N¹(X/K)` is nef (§2.3), and nothing here uses the spaces of higher codimension.
- The topological-entropy bound of Dinh and Sibony over `ℂ` (dinhsibony2005 Théorème 1), which uses positive currents.
- Dang and Favre's b-classes, Picard–Manin spaces and spectral gap, with their Theorems 1–2 (dangfavre2021 lines 148–180). They consume the degrees and dynamical degrees built here.
- Arithmetic degrees and canonical heights of rational self-maps of `ℙ^N` (silverman2014 §§4–5).
- Correspondences and resolution of singularities. No statement here uses either.

## Conventions

- `K` is a field. A *variety over K* is an integral scheme separated and of finite type over `Spec K`. A *projective variety* is a variety projective over `K` in the sense of StableReduction Layer 2, equivalently proper over `K` with an ample line bundle. `d = dim X`. Dynamical statements assume `d ≥ 1`; intersection-theoretic ones allow `d = 0`.
- *Ampleness* is Tau Ceti's `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.LineBundleClass.IsAmple`: the scheme is quasi-compact and every point lies in an affine nonvanishing locus of a global section of a positive power. On a scheme of finite type over `K` the high powers of an ample line bundle are very ample, and very ample line bundles are ample (AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry §1.4); this is a theorem about the native predicate, not a second definition. *Witness:* on `ℙ¹_K`, `O(1)` is ample through the sections `x_0, x_1`, whose nonvanishing loci are the two affine lines; `O` is not, because a section of a power of `O` is a constant, with nonvanishing locus `∅` or `ℙ¹`, and `ℙ¹` is not affine.
- Line bundles are Tau Ceti's `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.InvertibleSheaf`, written additively: `L + M` is the tensor product, `mL` the `m`-th tensor power, `−L` the dual. `Pic(X)` is `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.LineBundleClass X`. Pullback along `p` is written `p^*L`.
- *Intersection numbers.* For a proper `K`-scheme `X`, a closed subscheme `Z ⊆ X` of dimension `≤ r` and line bundles `L_1, …, L_r` on `X`, `(L_1 ⋯ L_r · Z)` is the numerical intersection of CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3: the coefficient of `n_1⋯n_r` in `χ_K(Z, n_1L_1 + ⋯ + n_rL_r)`. Write `(L_1 ⋯ L_r)_X` when `Z = X`, and `(L^r)` for equal entries. The number depends on `K`. *Witness:* on `ℙ¹_K`, `(O(a))_{ℙ¹} = a` for every integer `a`, because `χ(O(an)) = an + 1`. For a closed point `P` with `[κ(P) : K] = 2`, the empty intersection `( · P)` is `χ_K(O_P) = 2`; computed over `κ(P)` it is `1`.
- *Composition.* Mathlib's `Scheme.RationalMap.comp f g`, for `f : X ⤏ Y` dominant and `g : Y ⤏ Z`, applies `f` first. In prose it is `g ∘ f`. *Witness:* on `ℙ¹` with `f(z) = z²` and `g(z) = z + 1`, `f.comp g` is `z ↦ z² + 1`. Its value at `z = 1` is `2`, while `f ∘ g` takes the value `4` there. Iterates of a dominant self-map `f` are `f^0 = id` and `f^{n+1} = f^n ∘ f`; the composition is defined because `f` is dominant. By Mathlib's `Scheme.RationalMap.comp_assoc` this agrees with `f ∘ f^n`. Iterates of a morphism that need not be dominant, such as a constant morphism, are taken in the composition of morphisms (§6.1).
- *Birational maps.* A rational map `f : X ⤏ Y` is *birational* if it is `φ.toRationalMap` for a partial isomorphism `φ` (Mathlib's `Scheme.PartialIso`, an isomorphism between dense opens of `X` and `Y`) that is over `K` in the sense of `Scheme.PartialIso.IsOver`. A birational map is dominant. Its *inverse* `f^{−1}` is `φ.symm.toRationalMap`; it does not depend on `φ`, because its pullback is `(f^*)^{−1}` and §1.1 determines a dominant rational map by its pullback. A morphism is birational if its rational map is. Mathlib's `Scheme.Birational X Y` is the existence of some partial isomorphism between the schemes: a property of the pair, not of a map. *Witness:* `z ↦ z²` on `ℙ¹` is not birational (its pullback `K(z²) ⊆ K(z)` is not surjective), although `Scheme.Birational ℙ¹ ℙ¹` holds through the identity.
- *Degrees.* For `f : X ⤏ Y` dominant between projective varieties of the same dimension `d`, `0 ≤ k ≤ d`, and line bundles `L` on `X` and `M` on `Y`, `deg_k(f; L, M) = (π_1^*L^{d−k} · π_2^*M^k)_{Γ_f}`. The index `k` counts the copies pulled back from the *target*. For a self-map and `ω` on `X`, `deg_{k,ω}(f) = deg_k(f; ω, ω)`. *Witness:* for `f(z) = z²` on `ℙ¹` and `H = O(1)`, `deg_{0,H}(f) = 1` and `deg_{1,H}(f) = 2 = e(f)`. The opposite convention would give `deg_1 = 1`.
- *Topological degree.* `e(f) = dim_{f^*K(Y)} K(X)`, Mathlib's `Module.finrank`. It counts inseparable degree and takes the junk value `0` when `K(X)` is infinite-dimensional over `f^*K(Y)`. *Witness:* the Frobenius `[x_i] ↦ [x_i^p]` of `ℙ^d` over a field of characteristic `p` has `e = p^d`; the separable degree would be `1`.
- *Polarizations.* A *big and nef* line bundle is a nef `L` with `(L^d) > 0`. Nefness is that of AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.5 over the base `Spec K`: nonnegative degree on every integral curve; §3.1 reads it in numerical intersections. A *real class* is an element `ω = Σ t_i L_i` of `Pic(X) ⊗ ℝ`, a finite combination of line bundles with real coefficients of any sign. It is *nef* if `(ω · C) = Σ t_i (L_i · C) ≥ 0` for every integral closed curve `C ⊆ X`, equivalently if its image in `N¹(X/K)` lies in the nef cone `Nef(X/K)` (§2.3). Every class of `Nef(X/K)` is the image of a nef real class, because `Pic(X) ⊗ ℝ → N¹(X/K)` is onto. A *real polarization* is a nef real class `ω` with `(ω^d) > 0`. Every ample line bundle and every big and nef line bundle is a real polarization. *Witness:* on `E × E`, for a complex elliptic curve `E` without complex multiplication, the class `A` of the §3.1 Checks is nef with `(A²) = 0` and is no positive combination of nef line bundles; it is admitted as a nef input of §§3.2–3.6 and as `L_1` or `L_3` in §4.4. The ample class `A + (F_1 + F_2)` there is such a combination, while `A` lies on the boundary of the nef cone.
- *Dynamical degrees and entropy.* `λ_k(f) = lim_{n→∞} deg_{k,ω}(f^n)^{1/n}` and `h_alg(f) = log max_{0≤k≤d} λ_k(f)`, natural logarithm.
- *Fibonacci numbers* are Mathlib's `Nat.fib`, with `fib 0 = 0`, `fib 1 = fib 2 = 1` and `fib 3 = 2`. *Witness:* the Fibonacci map of §6.3 has `deg_{1,H}(f^n) = fib(n + 2)`. This is `1` for `n = 0` (the identity) and `2` for `n = 1`. The golden ratio is Mathlib's `Real.goldenRatio = (1 + √5)/2`.
- *Projective space* `ℙ^d_K` is Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.Proj` of `K[x_0, …, x_d]` graded by `MvPolynomial.homogeneousSubmodule`; `H = O(1)`.

## Exact supplier contracts

### From Mathlib

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.PartialMap` and `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.RationalMap` (Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Birational/RationalMap.lean:48, 377). A partial map is a morphism on a dense open. A rational map is its class under agreement on a dense open. `Scheme.RationalMap.domain` (line 575) is the union of the domains of the representatives. It is dense by `Scheme.RationalMap.dense_domain` (line 586). `Scheme.RationalMap.toPartialMap` (line 608) represents a rational map on its domain when the source is reduced and the target separated. `Scheme.RationalMap.IsOver` (line 396) says some representative is an `S`-map. `Scheme.RationalMap.compHom` (line 440) composes a rational map with a morphism applied after it; it needs no dominance.
- `Scheme.RationalMap.fromFunctionField` (line 501) is the morphism `Spec K(X) → Y` of a rational map from an irreducible scheme. `Scheme.RationalMap.equivFunctionFieldOver` (line 562) identifies `S`-morphisms `Spec K(X) → Y` with `S`-rational maps, for `X` integral and `Y` locally of finite type over `S`. These say nothing about dominance or field homomorphisms; §1.1 adds both.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.RationalMap.IsDominant` (Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Birational/Dominant.lean:74): some, equivalently every, representative is dominant.
- `Scheme.RationalMap.comp` (Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Birational/Composition.lean:155). It requires the first map dominant, the source preirreducible and the middle scheme nonempty. Also used: `Scheme.RationalMap.comp_assoc` (line 182), which assumes the middle schemes irreducible and nonempty, `Scheme.RationalMap.comp_id` (line 170), `Scheme.RationalMap.id_comp` (line 217), the dominance instance for composites (line 173) and `Scheme.RationalMap.isOver_comp` (line 193).
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.PartialIso` (Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Birational/Birational.lean:39) is an isomorphism between dense open subschemes, with `Scheme.PartialIso.IsOver` (line 55), its inverse `Scheme.PartialIso.symm` (line 88) and its rational map `Scheme.PartialIso.toRationalMap` (line 166). `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Birational X Y` (line 182) is the existence of a partial isomorphism between the two schemes; it is a relation between schemes, not a property of a rational map, which is why the Conventions define birational maps through partial isomorphisms.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.image`, `Scheme.Hom.imageι` and `Scheme.Hom.toImage` (Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/IdealSheaf/Subscheme.lean:658, 661, 706). The scheme-theoretic image is the closed subscheme cut out by `Scheme.Hom.ker` (Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/IdealSheaf/Basic.lean:691). `Scheme.Hom.toImage` is dominant for quasi-compact morphisms (Subscheme.lean:716). Mathlib does not state that the image of a reduced scheme is reduced; Tau Ceti does (below).
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsSchemeTheoreticallyDominant` (Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Morphisms/SchemeTheoreticallyDominant.lean:37), a morphism with zero kernel ideal sheaf, and `IsSchemeTheoreticallyDominant.of_isPullback` (line 112): the base change of a quasi-compact scheme-theoretically dominant morphism along a flat morphism is scheme-theoretically dominant. `Scheme.Hom.ker_comp` (Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/IdealSheaf/Functorial.lean:163) writes the kernel of a composite `p ≫ i` as the pushforward along `i` of the kernel of `p`, and `Scheme.IdealSheafData.map_bot` (line 139) says the pushforward of the zero ideal sheaf along `i` is the kernel of `i`. `Scheme.IdealSheafData.ker_fst_of_isClosedImmersion` (line 79) identifies the kernel of the base change of a closed immersion with the pulled-back ideal sheaf `Scheme.IdealSheafData.comap` (line 39). Mathlib does not state flat base change of `Scheme.Hom.image` itself; §1.4 obtains it from these.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.functionField` (Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/FunctionField.lean:37) is the stalk at the generic point; it is a field for integral schemes.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsFinite.iff_isProper_and_isAffineHom` (Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Morphisms/Proper.lean:97), with `AlgebraicGeometry.IsProper`, `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAffineHom`, `AlgebraicGeometry.IsDominant` and `AlgebraicGeometry.IsIntegral`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Proj` (Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/ProjectiveSpectrum/Scheme.lean:855), `MvPolynomial.homogeneousSubmodule` and `MvPolynomial.gradedAlgebra` (Mathlib/RingTheory/MvPolynomial/Homogeneous.lean:87, 613). Mathlib has `𝔸(n; S)` but no named projective space; `ℙ^d_K` is this `Proj`. `MvPolynomial.uniqueFactorizationMonoid` (Mathlib/RingTheory/Polynomial/UniqueFactorization.lean:128), the unique-factorization instance for polynomials over a unique factorization domain, gives greatest common divisors of forms.
- `Subadditive`, `Subadditive.lim`, `Subadditive.lim_le_div` and `Subadditive.tendsto_lim` (Mathlib/Analysis/Subadditive.lean:33, 106, 109, 155) are Fekete's lemma; `Subadditive` is generated from `Submultiplicative` (line 35). `Subadditive.lim` is the infimum of `u_n/n` over `n ≥ 1`. Convergence needs `u_n/n` bounded below over all `n`, including the value `u_0/0 = 0`.
- `Module.finrank` and `Module.finrank_mul_finrank` (Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Dimension/Free.lean:76), the tower law.
- `Nat.fib` (Mathlib/Data/Nat/Fib/Basic.lean:56) and `Real.goldenRatio` (Mathlib/NumberTheory/Real/GoldenRatio.lean:36).

Mathlib has no graph of a rational map, no field homomorphism attached to a dominant rational map or morphism, no intersection numbers and no positivity of line bundles.

### From Tau Ceti

- `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.InvertibleSheaf` (TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/LineBundle/Basic.lean:119), with `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.InvertibleSheaf.pullback` (LineBundle/Pullback.lean:100), `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.InvertibleSheaf.tensorProduct` (LineBundle/TensorProduct.lean:65) and `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.InvertibleSheaf.dual` (LineBundle/Dual.lean:44). `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.LineBundleClass` (LineBundle/Class.lean:50) is the Picard group, a commutative group (line 142).
- `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.LineBundleClass.IsAmple` (LineBundle/Ample.lean:71): `X` is quasi-compact and every point lies in an affine nonvanishing locus of a global section of a line bundle in a positive power of the class; `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.LineBundleClass.IsAmple.of_pow` (line 96) descends ampleness from a positive power. It is the ampleness of every statement here.
- `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.Cohomology` (Cohomology/Basic.lean:61) and the truncated Euler characteristic `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.eulerCharBelow` (Cohomology/EulerCharacteristic.lean:105). It sums `(−1)^i dim_K H^i` for `i < n`, with junk value `0` for infinite-dimensional terms. It equals `χ` once `n > dim` on a proper scheme.
- `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.LineBundleClass.eulerDegree` (LineBundle/Degree.lean:130), the degree `χ(L) − χ(O)` on curves, and the curve intersection number `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.LineBundleClass.intersectionNumber` (IntersectionNumber/Basic.lean:111), the Euler degree over `K` of the pullback of a class to a `K`-scheme `C → X`, with its field-tower scaling `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.LineBundleClass.intersectionNumber_eq_finrank_mul` (IntersectionNumber/FieldTower.lean:66). These are the case `r = 1` of the numerical intersections below; Tau Ceti has no intersection numbers of several line bundles on a scheme of higher dimension.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData.IsEffectiveCartier` (TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EffectiveCartierDivisor/Basic.lean:78), effective Cartier divisors as ideal sheaves locally generated by a regular element.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.isReduced_image` (TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/SchemeTheoreticImage/Basic.lean:78): the scheme-theoretic image of a quasi-compact morphism from a reduced scheme is reduced. It is deduced from `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.isSchemeTheoreticallyDominant_toImage` (line 65): for a quasi-compact morphism, the factorization `Scheme.Hom.toImage` through the scheme-theoretic image is scheme-theoretically dominant.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldMap` (TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/Morphisms/Dominant.lean:151), the pullback `K(Y) → K(X)` of a dominant morphism of irreducible schemes, with `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldMap_id` (line 206), `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldMap_comp` (line 212) and `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.ext_of_functionFieldMap_eq` (line 221), which determines a dominant morphism from a reduced irreducible scheme to a separated one by its pullback. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldAlgHom` (TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/BaseAlgebra.lean:409) is the same map as a `K`-algebra homomorphism, for a dominant `K`-morphism of integral `K`-schemes, with `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldAlgHom_id` (line 421) and `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldAlgHom_comp` (line 427).
- `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.topologicalKrullDim_eq_toNat_trdeg_functionField` (TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/FunctionField.lean:101): an integral scheme locally of finite type over `K` has dimension `trdeg_K K(X)`.

### From TauCetiRoadmap.CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger

- §4.3, numerical intersection. For `X` proper over `K`, `Z ⊆ X` closed of dimension `≤ d` and line bundles `L_1, …, L_d`, `(L_1 ⋯ L_d · Z)` is the coefficient of `n_1⋯n_d` in `χ(Z, (L_1|_Z)^{n_1} ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ (L_d|_Z)^{n_d})`. This roadmap consumes the following from it:
  - polynomiality of `χ(F ⊗ L_1^{n_1} ⊗ ⋯)` of total degree `≤ dim Supp F` for every coherent `F`;
  - symmetry and additivity in each `L_i`;
  - the projection formula: for `p : Y → X` a morphism of proper `K`-schemes and `Z ⊆ Y` integral of dimension `d`, `(p^*L_1 ⋯ p^*L_d · Z) = deg(Z → p(Z)) (L_1 ⋯ L_d · p(Z))`, and `0` if `dim p(Z) < d`;
  - the Cartier-divisor restriction formula `(L_1 ⋯ L_d · Z) = (L_2 ⋯ L_d · D)` when `L_1|_Z ≅ O_Z(D)` for an effective Cartier divisor `D ⊆ Z`;
  - positivity for ample `L_i`;
  - field-extension compatibility: for `K'/K`, `(L_{1,K'} ⋯ L_{d,K'} · Z_{K'})` over `K'` equals `(L_1 ⋯ L_d · Z)` over `K`.

### From TauCetiRoadmap.AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII

- §0.1: the degree `χ(C, L) − χ(C, O_C)` of a line bundle on a proper `K`-scheme `C` of dimension `≤ 1`, with the length-weighted component law `deg(L) = Σ_i length(O_{C,η_i})·deg(L|_{(C_i)_red})` over the one-dimensional components, and its invariance under extension of the field.
- §1.1, over the base `S = Spec K`: for a proper `K`-scheme `X`, `Num(X/K) = Pic(X)/Pic^τ(X/K)` and `N¹(X/K) = Num(X/K) ⊗ ℝ`, with the class map `Pic(X) → Num(X/K)`; the degree pairing of line bundles with integral curves descends to `Num(X/K)`, hence extends linearly to `N¹(X/K)`.
- §1.5, over the base `S = Spec K`. A line bundle `L` on a proper `K`-scheme `X` is nef if its degree on every integral closed curve `C ⊆ X` is `≥ 0`; a class of `N¹(X/K)` is nef if it pairs nonnegatively with every curve, and these classes form the closed convex cone `Nef(X/K)`; `L` is nef if and only if its class lies in `Nef(X/K)`. Nef classes are closed under sums and positive scaling. If `g : X' → X` is a `K`-morphism of proper `K`-schemes and `L` is nef, `g^*L` is nef. Nefness is preserved by base change along every morphism of Noetherian schemes, in particular along `Spec K' → Spec K` for every field extension `K'/K`, and is detected after extension to an algebraic closure. No integrality, perfection of `K` or restriction on the characteristic is assumed.

From the same section: an ample line bundle has positive degree on every integral curve, so it is nef; and for `L` ample and every line bundle `E`, `L^{⊗m} ⊗ E` is ample for all sufficiently large `m`.

For a flat morphism `S' → S` of locally Noetherian schemes, the schematic image of the base change `Z ×_S S' → S'` is the inverse image `h.image ×_S S'`. Nothing is assumed for base change that is not flat, where the statement fails (§1.4, Checks).

## How to read the build

Layer 1 is closest to Mathlib. It attaches to a dominant rational map its pullback of function fields, its topological degree and its graph, and records how graphs behave under composition, normalization and extension of the field. Layer 2 fixes the intersection numbers. It proves the component formula and the comparison with Chow degrees, extends the numbers to real coefficients, and reduces homogeneous inequalities to an integral variety over an algebraically closed field. Layer 3 reads the imported nefness and Kleiman's theorem in numerical intersections, approximates nef real classes by ample line bundles, then proves over an arbitrary field, in the order the proofs need, Siu's inequality, the Hodge inequality on surfaces, Khovanskii–Teissier, and Siu for products. Layer 4 defines the degrees on the graph and proves their values, invariances, sub-multiplicativity and the comparison theorems. Layer 5 defines the dynamical degrees and the algebraic entropy and proves their properties. Layer 6 computes on projective and affine space. A *Needs:* line lists what a statement and its suggested route use, so a different proof may omit route-only inputs.

The headline statements are the following:

- integrality, projectivity and the projection properties of the graph (§1.2);
- Khovanskii–Teissier and Siu for products over an arbitrary field (§§3.5–3.6);
- positivity and the boundary values of the degrees (§4.2), and their invariance under extension of the field (§4.3);
- sub-multiplicativity (§4.4) and the comparison theorems (§4.5);
- existence and properties of `λ_k` and of `h_alg` (§§5.1–5.4);
- the degree formulas on projective space and the Cremona and Fibonacci computations (§§6.2–6.4).

## Layer 1: Function fields and the graph of a dominant rational map

Throughout, `X`, `Y`, `Z` are varieties over `K` and rational maps are `K`-rational maps in the sense of Mathlib's `Scheme.RationalMap.IsOver` over `Spec K`.

### 1.1 Pullback of function fields and topological degree

Define the *pullback* `f^* : K(Y) → K(X)` of a dominant rational map `f : X ⤏ Y`. Choose a representative `f_V : V → Y` over `K` on a dense open `V`; it is a dominant `K`-morphism of integral `K`-schemes, and Tau Ceti's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldAlgHom` gives a `K`-algebra map `K(Y) → K(V)`. Compose it with the identification `K(V) = K(X)` of the function field of a dense open of the integral `X`. The result does not depend on the representative: two representatives agree on a dense open `V'`, and by `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldAlgHom_comp` the pullback along the restriction to `V'` is the pullback along either one, followed by `K(V) = K(V')`. Equivalently, `f^*` is the map of stalks at the generic points induced by Mathlib's `Scheme.RationalMap.fromFunctionField f : Spec K(X) → Y`, which hits the generic point of `Y` because `f` is dominant. Define the *topological degree* `e(f) = dim_{f^*K(Y)} K(X)` with Mathlib's `Module.finrank` (stacks-morphisms Definition 52.8, line 6046, for the degree of a dominant generically finite morphism; dinhsibony2005 lines 69–70 for the topological degree as the number of preimages of a generic point over `ℂ`).

- For a dominant `K`-morphism `g : X → Y`, the pullback of its rational map is Tau Ceti's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldAlgHom` of `g`. When `g` is an alteration this is the function-field map of SchemeAndStackFoundations §4.16, and `e(g)` is the generic degree there.
- *Functoriality.* For `f : X ⤏ Y` and `g : Y ⤏ Z` dominant, `(g ∘ f)^* = f^* ∘ g^*`, and the identity rational map has pullback the identity. On representatives this is Tau Ceti's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldAlgHom_comp` and `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldAlgHom_id`.
- *Determination.* `f ↦ f^*` is a bijection between dominant `K`-rational maps `X ⤏ Y` and `K`-algebra homomorphisms `K(Y) → K(X)`. The proof composes `Scheme.RationalMap.equivFunctionFieldOver` with the correspondence between `K`-morphisms `Spec K(X) → Y` hitting the generic point and `K`-embeddings of function fields, using that `Y` is of finite type.
- *Finiteness.* `e(f)` is a positive integer if and only if `dim X = dim Y`. If `dim X > dim Y`, then `K(X)` has positive transcendence degree over `f^*K(Y)` and `e(f) = 0` is a junk value. The proof uses Tau Ceti's `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.topologicalKrullDim_eq_toNat_trdeg_functionField`, and finite generation of `K(X)` over `K`.
- *Multiplicativity.* If `dim X = dim Y = dim Z`, then `e(g ∘ f) = e(f)·e(g)`, by Mathlib's `Module.finrank_mul_finrank` applied to `f^*g^*K(Z) ⊆ f^*K(Y) ⊆ K(X)`. The pullback `f^*` is injective, being a homomorphism of fields, and carries `g^*K(Z) ⊆ K(Y)` onto `f^*g^*K(Z) ⊆ f^*K(Y)`.
- *Birationality.* If `dim X = dim Y`, then `e(f) = 1` if and only if `f^*` is an isomorphism, if and only if `f` is birational in the sense of the Conventions. For the last step: when `f^*` is an isomorphism, determination gives a dominant `g : Y ⤏ X` with `g^* = (f^*)^{−1}`; then `(g ∘ f)^* = id` and `(f ∘ g)^* = id`, so `g ∘ f = id_X` and `f ∘ g = id_Y` by determination. Representatives `f_U` and `g_V` therefore compose to the identity on dense opens `U' ⊆ U` and `V' ⊆ V`, and they restrict to inverse isomorphisms between `U_0 = U' ∩ f_U^{−1}(V')` and `V_0 = V' ∩ g_V^{−1}(U')`, a partial isomorphism over `K` whose rational map is `f`. In that case `X` and `Y` are birational in Mathlib's sense `Scheme.Birational X Y`, and `f^{−1}` has pullback `(f^*)^{−1}`.

*Needs:* Mathlib `Scheme.RationalMap.fromFunctionField`, `Scheme.RationalMap.equivFunctionFieldOver`, `Scheme.RationalMap.IsDominant`, `Scheme.functionField`, `Module.finrank`, `Module.finrank_mul_finrank`, `Scheme.PartialIso`, `Scheme.PartialIso.IsOver`, `Scheme.PartialIso.symm`, `Scheme.PartialIso.toRationalMap`; Tau Ceti `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldAlgHom`, `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldAlgHom_comp`, `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.functionFieldAlgHom_id`, `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.topologicalKrullDim_eq_toNat_trdeg_functionField`; SchemeAndStackFoundations §4.16.

**Checks.**

- For `f(z) = z²` on `ℙ¹`, `f^*(z) = z²` and `e(f) = [K(z) : K(z²)] = 2` in every characteristic. In characteristic `2` the extension is purely inseparable. A convention counting separable degree would give `1` there.
- For the Frobenius `[x_i] ↦ [x_i^p]` of `ℙ^d` over a field of characteristic `p`, `f^*` is `x_i ↦ x_i^p` on affine coordinates and `e(f) = p^d`.
- The standard Cremona involution of `ℙ²` has `e = 1` and is birational, although its forms have degree `2`. Multiplicativity gives `e(σ ∘ σ) = 1`.
- Non-example: `f(z) = z²` on `ℙ¹` has `e(f) = 2`, `f^*` is not surjective, and `f` is the rational map of no partial isomorphism, so the three conditions of the birationality item fail together. Yet `Scheme.Birational ℙ¹ ℙ¹` holds, through the identity. A definition of "birational `f`" through Mathlib's relation on the pair would make the item false.
- The linear projection `ℙ² ⤏ ℙ¹` from `[0 : 0 : 1]` is dominant with `K(x, y)` of transcendence degree one over `K(x)`, so `e = 0` is the junk value. The finiteness item excludes it.
- Non-example: a constant map `ℙ¹ → ℙ¹` is not dominant and has no pullback of function fields; Mathlib's composition with it as the first map is not defined.

### 1.2 The graph

Let `X`, `Y` be projective varieties and `f : X ⤏ Y` a rational map. Let `U` be its domain (Mathlib's `Scheme.RationalMap.domain`) and `f_U : U → Y` the representative of `Scheme.RationalMap.toPartialMap`. Define the *graph* `Γ_f ⊆ X ×_K Y` as the scheme-theoretic image (Mathlib's `Scheme.Hom.image`) of the `K`-morphism `γ_f = (ι_U, f_U) : U → X ×_K Y`. Its *projections* `π_1 : Γ_f → X` and `π_2 : Γ_f → Y` are the compositions of `Scheme.Hom.imageι` with the projections of the product (dinhsibony2005 lines 45–51; dang2020 lines 21–25; guedj2010 lines 1099–1110).

Prove the following.

- `Γ_f` is integral, closed in `X ×_K Y`, projective over `K`, and of dimension `dim X`. The morphism `γ_f` is quasi-compact because `X` is Noetherian, so its image is reduced (Tau Ceti's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.isReduced_image`, for a quasi-compact morphism from the reduced `U`) and is the closure of the image of the integral scheme `U` (stacks-morphisms Lemma 6.7, line 488).
- *Independence of the representative.* For every partial map `(V, g)` representing `f`, the scheme-theoretic image of `(ι_V, g)` is `Γ_f`.
- `π_1` is proper and birational, and `π_1^{−1}(U) → U` is an isomorphism with inverse `γ_f`. Hence `π_1` is a modification in the sense of SchemeAndStackFoundations §4.11 with witness `U`. The graph of `f_U` is closed in `U ×_K Y` because `Y` is separated.
- `π_2 ∘ γ_f = f_U`. If `f` is dominant, `π_2` is dominant and, being proper, surjective. If moreover `dim X = dim Y`, `π_2` is an alteration (SchemeAndStackFoundations §4.16) with generic degree `e(f)`, computed through the isomorphism `π_1^* : K(X) → K(Γ_f)`.
- *Morphisms.* If `f` is the rational map of a morphism `g : X → Y`, then `U = X`, `π_1` is an isomorphism and `π_2 ∘ π_1^{−1} = g`. For `g = id_X` the graph is the diagonal.
- *Inverses.* If `f` is birational, the exchange of factors `X ×_K Y ≅ Y ×_K X` maps `Γ_f` onto `Γ_{f^{−1}}`.

*Needs:* Mathlib `Scheme.RationalMap.domain`, `Scheme.RationalMap.toPartialMap`, `Scheme.Hom.image`, `Scheme.Hom.imageι`, `Scheme.Hom.toImage`, `AlgebraicGeometry.IsProper`, `AlgebraicGeometry.IsDominant`, `Scheme.PartialIso.symm`; Tau Ceti `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.isReduced_image`; §1.1; SchemeAndStackFoundations §§0.7, 4.11, 4.16; StableReduction Layer 2.

**Checks.**

- For `f = id_X`, `Γ_f` is the diagonal and both projections are isomorphisms.
- For `f(z) = z²` on `ℙ¹`, `Γ_f ≅ ℙ¹` through `π_1`, and `π_2` has generic degree `2 = e(f)`.
- For the Cremona involution `σ[x : y : z] = [yz : xz : xy]` of `ℙ²`, the domain is the complement of the three coordinate points. The fibre of `π_1` over each of them is a line. Both projections are birational, and `Γ_σ` is the blow-up of `ℙ²` at the three points.
- For the projection `ℙ² ⤏ ℙ¹` from `[0 : 0 : 1]`, `Γ` is the blow-up at that point and `π_2` is surjective with fibres `ℙ¹`. It is not an alteration, so the equal-dimension hypothesis is needed.
- Non-example: for the constant map `ℙ¹ → ℙ¹` with value `[0 : 1]`, `Γ = ℙ¹ × {[0 : 1]}` and `π_2` is not surjective. Dominance is needed for surjectivity.

### 1.3 Graphs of composites

Let `X`, `Y`, `Z` be projective varieties of the same dimension `d` and let `f : X ⤏ Y` and `g : Y ⤏ Z` be dominant. The product `Y ×_K Z` need not be integral, so it is not a variety and §1.2 does not apply to a map into it; the construction below uses only the integral source. Let `U` be the intersection of the domains of `f` and `g ∘ f`, a dense open of `X`, and let `f_U`, `(g∘f)_U` be the representatives of `Scheme.RationalMap.toPartialMap` restricted to `U`. Define the *correspondence of the composite* `W_{f,g} ⊆ X ×_K Y ×_K Z` as the scheme-theoretic image of the `K`-morphism `(ι_U, f_U, (g∘f)_U) : U → X ×_K Y ×_K Z`, with projections `q_X`, `q_Y`, `q_Z`. Prove:

- `W_{f,g}` is an integral projective variety of dimension `d`. The morphism is quasi-compact because `U` is Noetherian, so its image is reduced (Tau Ceti's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.isReduced_image`) and is the closure of the image of the irreducible `U`, hence integral; it is closed in the projective `K`-scheme `X ×_K Y ×_K Z`. Replacing `U` by a smaller dense open does not change the image. No integrality of `Y ×_K Z` is used;
- `(q_X, q_Y) : W_{f,g} → Γ_f` and `(q_X, q_Z) : W_{f,g} → Γ_{g∘f}` are proper and birational;
- `(q_Y, q_Z) : W_{f,g} → Γ_g` is proper and surjective, and generically finite of generic degree `e(f)`. Its function-field extension is `K(Γ_g) ≅ K(Y) → K(X) ≅ K(W_{f,g})`, which is `f^*`.

The construction applies to iterates. For `f : X ⤏ X` and `m, n ≥ 1`, `W_{f^m, f^n}` relates `Γ_{f^m}`, `Γ_{f^n}` and `Γ_{f^{m+n}}` (dang2020 lines 1285–1334, the graph of `π_3^{−1} ∘ f_1 ∘ π_1` and diagram (5.1)).

*Needs:* Mathlib `Scheme.RationalMap.comp`, `Scheme.RationalMap.comp_assoc`, `Scheme.RationalMap.domain`, `Scheme.RationalMap.toPartialMap`, `Scheme.Hom.image`; Tau Ceti `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.isReduced_image`; §§1.1–1.2; SchemeAndStackFoundations §4.16; StableReduction Layer 2.

**Checks.**

- `K = ℝ`, `X = Y = Z = ℙ¹_ℂ` regarded as `ℝ`-varieties and `f = g = id`. Since `ℂ ⊗_ℝ ℂ ≅ ℂ × ℂ`, the product `Y ×_ℝ Z` has two components and is not a variety, so §1.2 cannot be applied to a map into it. The direct image `W_{id,id}` is the triple diagonal, a copy of `ℙ¹_ℂ`, integral of dimension `1`, and all three indicated projections onto the graphs have degree `1`.
- For `f = g = σ` the Cremona involution of `ℙ²`, `σ ∘ σ = id`. Then `W_{σ,σ} → Γ_{id}` (the diagonal) is birational and `(q_Y, q_Z)` has degree `e(σ) = 1`.
- For `f = g = (z ↦ z²)` on `ℙ¹`, `W_{f,g} ≅ ℙ¹` through `q_X`, and `(q_Y, q_Z)` maps onto `Γ_g ≅ ℙ¹` with degree `2 = e(f)`, not `e(g ∘ f) = 4`.
- If `f` is replaced by a non-dominant map, `g ∘ f` is not defined by Mathlib's composition and the construction does not apply.

### 1.4 Normalization and extension of the field

*Normalization.* Let `ν : X̃ → X` be the normalization of a projective variety. It is finite and birational (SchemeAndStackFoundations §§0.20, 0.30), so `X̃` is a projective variety. For `f : X ⤏ X` dominant put `f̃ = ν^{−1} ∘ f ∘ ν : X̃ ⤏ X̃`, with `ν^{−1}` the inverse (Conventions) of the birational morphism `ν`, which is an isomorphism over the dense open normal locus of `X`. Prove that `ν × ν` maps `Γ_{f̃}` onto `Γ_f`, properly and birationally, and that `(f^n)~ = f̃^n`.

*Extension of the field.* Let `K'/K` be a field extension. Prove that `(Γ_f)_{K'} ⊆ (X ×_K Y)_{K'}` is the scheme-theoretic image of `γ_f ×_K K'`. This is flat base change of scheme-theoretic images (AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry §5.4, its scheme case; stacks-morphisms Lemma 26.16, line 2198). It applies because `γ_f` is quasi-compact with Noetherian source `U`, `Spec K' → Spec K` is flat, and `X ×_K Y` and its base change are of finite type over a field, hence Noetherian. From Mathlib and Tau Ceti alone, the same statement follows from the factorization of `γ_f` as `Scheme.Hom.toImage` followed by the closed immersion `Scheme.Hom.imageι`. The first factor is scheme-theoretically dominant (Tau Ceti's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.isSchemeTheoreticallyDominant_toImage`) and stays so after the flat base change (Mathlib's `IsSchemeTheoreticallyDominant.of_isPullback`). By `Scheme.Hom.ker_comp` and `Scheme.IdealSheafData.map_bot`, the kernel of `γ_f ×_K K'` is then the kernel of the base-changed closed immersion. By `Scheme.IdealSheafData.ker_fst_of_isClosedImmersion` that kernel is the pullback of the ideal sheaf of `Γ_f`. If `X` and `Y` are geometrically integral, `X_{K'}` and `Y_{K'}` are projective varieties over `K'`. Let `f_{K'}` be the rational map of `(f_U)_{K'}`. It is dominant when `f` is; `e(f_{K'}) = e(f)`; `(g ∘ f)_{K'} = g_{K'} ∘ f_{K'}`; and `Γ_{f_{K'}} = (Γ_f)_{K'}` (truong2020 §6.3, line 1529).

For `e(f_{K'}) = e(f)` the proof splits by dimension; `dim X ≥ dim Y` because `f` is dominant.

- If `dim X = dim Y`, then `e(f) ≥ 1` and `K(X)` has a basis of `e(f)` elements over `f^*K(Y)` (§1.1, finiteness). So `K(X) ⊗_K K'` is free of rank `e(f)` over `f^*K(Y) ⊗_K K'`. Both rings are domains, being localizations of coordinate rings of affine opens of the integral `X_{K'}` and `Y_{K'}`, with fraction fields `K(X_{K'})` and `K(Y_{K'})`. Inverting the nonzero elements of `f^*K(Y) ⊗_K K'` turns `K(X) ⊗_K K'` into a domain finite over the field `K(Y_{K'})`, hence a field between `K(X) ⊗_K K'` and its fraction field, that is `K(X_{K'})`. So `[K(X_{K'}) : K(Y_{K'})] = e(f)`.
- If `dim X > dim Y`, the finite-basis argument does not apply: `K(X)` is infinite-dimensional over `f^*K(Y)`, and `e(f) = 0` is the junk value of §1.1, not a rank. Dimension does not change under extension of the field (SchemeAndStackFoundations §0.7), so `dim X_{K'} = dim X > dim Y = dim Y_{K'}`, and §1.1 gives `e(f_{K'}) = 0 = e(f)`.

*Needs:* Mathlib `Scheme.PartialIso`, `Scheme.PartialIso.symm`, `Scheme.Hom.image`; for the base change of the image, AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry §5.4, or directly Mathlib `IsSchemeTheoreticallyDominant.of_isPullback`, `Scheme.Hom.ker_comp`, `Scheme.IdealSheafData.map_bot`, `Scheme.IdealSheafData.ker_fst_of_isClosedImmersion` with Tau Ceti `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.isSchemeTheoreticallyDominant_toImage`; §§1.1–1.2; SchemeAndStackFoundations §§0.7, 0.11, 0.20, 0.30.

**Checks.**

- `X = ℙ¹_ℂ` regarded as an `ℝ`-scheme is integral but not geometrically integral: `X_ℂ = ℙ¹_ℂ ⊔ ℙ¹_ℂ`. The base change of the graph of `id_X` is the union of the two diagonals, a reducible scheme that is not the graph of a rational map of an integral scheme. The geometric-integrality hypothesis is needed for `Γ_{f_{K'}}`.
- Negative control for flatness: `h : 𝔾_m = Spec K[t, t^{−1}] → 𝔸¹_K` has scheme-theoretic image `𝔸¹_K`, because `K[t] → K[t, t^{−1}]` is injective. Base change along the origin `Spec K → 𝔸¹_K`, which is not flat, makes the source `Spec(K[t, t^{−1}]/(t)) = ∅`, whose image is empty, while the inverse image of `𝔸¹_K` is the point `Spec K`. Extensions of the ground field are flat, so this failure does not occur in §1.4.
- For the Cremona involution over `ℚ`, the base change to `ℂ` is the Cremona involution over `ℂ` and `e = 1` on both sides.
- For the cuspidal cubic `X = V(y²z − x³) ⊆ ℙ²` with normalization `ℙ¹ → X`, `t ↦ [t² : t³ : 1]`, the lift of `id_X` is `id_{ℙ¹}`.
- Negative control for the rank argument: take `K' = K` and the linear projection `ℙ² ⤏ ℙ¹` from `[0 : 0 : 1]`, with `K(X) = K(u, v)` over `f^*K(Y) = K(u)`. The family `1, v, v², …` is linearly independent, so `K(X)` is not free of rank `e(f) = 0`; the dimension difference is `1` before and after extension, and both degrees are the junk value `0`. For `z ↦ z²` on `ℙ¹`, the basis `{1, z}` of `K(z)` over `K(z²)` stays a basis after extension in every characteristic, and `e = 2` on both sides.

### Examples

## Layer 2: Intersection numbers over a field

### 2.1 The component formula

Let `X` be proper over `K`, `Z ⊆ X` a closed subscheme of dimension `r`, and `L_1, …, L_r` line bundles on `X`. Let `Z_1, …, Z_s` be the irreducible components of `Z` of dimension `r`, with reduced structure, and `m_i` the length of `O_{Z,ξ_i}` at their generic points. Prove `(L_1 ⋯ L_r · Z) = Σ_i m_i (L_1 ⋯ L_r · Z_i)` (stacks-varieties Lemmas 45.2 and 45.6, lines 4716 and 4784; kleiman2005 Lemma B.12, line 3624). The proof filters a coherent module by subquotients `(V → X)_*I` with `V` integral and `I` a nonzero ideal sheaf, and uses additivity of `χ` and of lengths. For `r = 1` the formula is the length-weighted component law for curve degrees of AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §0.1, since `(L · Z)` is the degree `χ(Z, L) − χ(Z, O_Z)` of `L|_Z`; the statement here is its form in every dimension.

*Needs:* CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3 (polynomiality, definition); SchemeAndStackFoundations §2.6 (finite-dimensional cohomology). For `r = 1`: AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §0.1.

**Checks.**

- The double point `Z = Spec K[ε]/(ε²) ⊆ ℙ¹` has `( · Z) = χ(O_Z) = 2 = 2·( · Z_red)`. A formula ignoring multiplicities gives `1`.
- For `Z = L ∪ P ⊆ ℙ²`, a line and a point off it, and `r = 1`, `(O(1) · Z) = 1`. The zero-dimensional component does not count, though the total degree of `Z` is `2`.
- For a conic `Z = V(xy) ⊆ ℙ²`, `(O(1) · Z) = 2 = 1 + 1` over the two lines.

### 2.2 Comparison with Chow degrees

Let `X` be proper over `K` and `Z ⊆ X` closed of dimension `r`. Prove `(L_1 ⋯ L_r · Z) = deg(c_1(L_1) ∩ ⋯ ∩ c_1(L_r) ∩ [Z]_r)`, with `[Z]_r` the fundamental cycle and the degree of zero-cycles of SchemeAndStackFoundations §5.2 (stacks-chow Lemma 41.4, tag 0BFI, line 3995). The proof inducts on `r`. It reduces to `Z` integral by §2.1, then to `Z` projective by Chow's lemma (SchemeAndStackFoundations §4.12) and the projection formula on both sides. It writes `L_1` as a difference of effective Cartier divisors, and finishes with the Cartier restriction formula and SchemeAndStackFoundations §5.3's `c_1(O(D)) ∩ [Z] = [D]`. For `r ≤ 1` it is SchemeAndStackFoundations §3.3's degree.

This identifies the numbers of ArakelovGeometryAndAbelianHeightsPartII §0.3 and of SchemeAndStackFoundations §5.10 with numerical intersections.

*Needs:* §2.1; CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3; SchemeAndStackFoundations §§3.3, 4.12, 5.1–5.3; StableReduction Layer 2.

**Checks.**

- On `ℙ²`, `(O(1)²) = 1 = deg(h² ∩ [ℙ²])`.
- On `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹`, `(O(1,0) · O(0,1)) = 1` and `(O(1,0)²) = 0`, matching `χ(O(n_1, n_2)) = (n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)` on the numerical side.
- On a smooth projective surface, Riemann–Roch (SchemeAndStackFoundations §5.10) shows that the coefficient of `n_1n_2` in `χ(O(n_1D_1 + n_2D_2))` is the Chow intersection `D_1·D_2`.

### 2.3 Real coefficients

For a proper `K`-scheme `X` of dimension `≤ r`, extend `(L_1, …, L_r) ↦ (L_1 ⋯ L_r)_X` to a symmetric `ℝ`-multilinear form on `Pic(X) ⊗ ℝ`, using additivity (CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3). Extend pullback along a morphism `p` linearly.

- The form is well defined on classes, symmetric and multilinear, and agrees with the integral numbers on `Pic(X)`.
- *Projection formula.* For `p : Y → X` a morphism of proper `K`-schemes with `Y` integral of dimension `r`, `(p^*ω_1 ⋯ p^*ω_r)_Y = deg(Y → p(Y))·(ω_1 ⋯ ω_r · p(Y))` for real classes `ω_i`, and `0` if `dim p(Y) < r`.
- *Field extension.* Base change along `K'/K` preserves the form.

A real class `ω = Σ t_i L_i` (finitely many line bundles `L_i`, real `t_i` of any sign) is *nef* if `(ω · C) = Σ t_i (L_i · C) ≥ 0` for every integral closed curve `C ⊆ X`. The value `(ω · C)` is the form above with `r = 1` on `C`, so it does not depend on how `ω` is written. Prove that `ω` is nef if and only if its image under `Pic(X) ⊗ ℝ → N¹(X/K)` lies in the nef cone `Nef(X/K)`: the degree pairing descends to `Num(X/K)` and is linear on `N¹(X/K)` (AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.1), and a class of `N¹(X/K)` is nef exactly when it pairs nonnegatively with every integral curve (its §1.5). The map `Pic(X) ⊗ ℝ → N¹(X/K)` is onto, so every class of `Nef(X/K)` comes from a nef real class. If moreover `(ω^d) > 0`, with `d = dim X`, `ω` is a *real polarization*.

*Needs:* CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3; AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §§1.1, 1.5; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.LineBundleClass`.

**Checks.**

- On `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹`, `ω = √2·O(1,0) + O(0,1)` has `(ω²) = 2√2`.
- Scaling: `((tω)^r) = t^r (ω^r)` for real `t`. At `t = −1` and `r = 1`, `(−O(1))_{ℙ¹} = −1`, so `−O(1)` is not nef.
- On `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹`, `ω = O(1,0) + O(0,1)` is a real polarization with `(ω²) = 2`, though neither summand is big.
- Nefness belongs to the class, not to a representation: on `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹`, `2·O(1,1) − O(1,0)` has a negative coefficient, but it is the class of `O(1,2)`, with degrees `2` and `1` on the two rulings, so it is nef and even ample. A definition through the signs of the coefficients of a chosen representation would call it not nef. The map to `N¹(ℙ¹ × ℙ¹/K) ≅ ℝ²` sends it to `(1, 2)`, in the nef quadrant.

### 2.4 Reduction to an integral variety over an algebraically closed field

Let `V` be an integral projective `K`-scheme of dimension `r`. Let `ν : Ṽ → V` be its normalization and `K' = H⁰(Ṽ, O_Ṽ)`. Let `Ω` be an algebraic closure of `K'` and `W = (Ṽ ×_{K'} Ω)_red`. Prove the following.

- (a) `K'` is a finite field extension of `K`, algebraically closed in `K(Ṽ)`. Hence `Ṽ` is geometrically irreducible over `K'` (stacks-varieties Lemma 8.6, tag 054Q, line 691), and `W` is an integral projective variety over `Ω` with `[Ṽ_Ω] = m[W]` for an integer `m ≥ 1`.
- (b) There is a positive integer `c_V = [K' : K]·m` such that `(L_1 ⋯ L_r)_{V/K} = c_V·(L_1|_W ⋯ L_r|_W)_{W/Ω}` for all line bundles `L_1, …, L_r` on `V`. Here `L|_W` is the pullback along `W → Ṽ_Ω → Ṽ → V`, and the equality extends to real classes.
- (c) The pullback to `W` of an ample line bundle on `V` is ample. The morphism `W → V` is affine, being the composite of a closed immersion, the base change of `Spec Ω → Spec K'` and the finite `ν`; it is not finite when `Ω/K'` is infinite. Being affine it is quasi-affine, and stacks-morphisms Lemma 38.7 (2), line 3862, applied once to it, gives the claim.

For (b): the projection formula along `ν`, of degree one, gives the numbers on `Ṽ`. An Euler characteristic over `K` is `[K' : K]` times the one over `K'`. Extending the field to `Ω` changes nothing, and §2.1 gives `m`. Every inequality between products of two intersection numbers, homogeneous of degree one in each factor, therefore holds on `V` once it holds on `W`. The behaviour of nef line bundles under this reduction is §3.1.

*Needs:* §§2.1, 2.3; CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3 (projection formula, field extension); SchemeAndStackFoundations §§0.20, 0.30; StableReduction Layer 2.

**Checks.**

- `V = ℙ¹_ℂ` as an `ℝ`-scheme: `K' = ℂ`, `W = ℙ¹_ℂ`, `m = 1`, `c_V = 2`, and `(O(1))_{V/ℝ} = 2 = 2·1`.
- `V = Proj ℝ[x, y, z]/(x² + y² + z²)`, the conic without real points: `K' = ℝ` and `W` is a smooth conic over `ℂ`. Then `c_V = 1` and `(O(1))_{V} = 2 = (O(1))_{W}`.
- Over `K = 𝔽_2(t)`, `V = Proj K[x, y, z]/(x² + t y²)` is integral but not normal: at the `K`-point `[0 : 0 : 1]` the cotangent space has dimension `2`, because `x² + t y²` lies in the square of the maximal ideal, so the one-dimensional local ring there is not regular. Its normalization is `ℙ¹_{K'}` with `K' = K(√t)`: the chart `y ≠ 0` is `Spec K[x, z]/(x² + t) = 𝔸¹_{K'}`, and the `K'`-point at infinity is pinched to `[0 : 0 : 1]`. So `H⁰(V, O_V) = K` (a plane conic) while `K' = H⁰(Ṽ, O_Ṽ) = K(√t)`; `Ṽ` is geometrically integral over `K'`, `m = 1` and `c_V = 2`. Since `χ_K(O_V(n)) = 2n + 1` and `ν^*O(1) = O_{ℙ¹_{K'}}(1)`, `(O(1))_{V/K} = 2 = 2·(O(1)|_Ṽ)_{Ṽ/K'}`: the value passes through the normalization, as (a) requires. Base change to `K'` instead gives the double line `(x + √t·y)²` with fundamental cycle `2·[line]` and the same value `2·1`.
- Non-example: let `V` be `ℙ¹_ℂ` over `ℝ` with the conjugate points `i, −i` pinched to one real point. Then `V` is integral with `H⁰(V, O_V) = ℝ`, but `ℂ ⊆ K(V) = ℂ(t)`. So `V` is not geometrically irreducible over `H⁰(V, O_V)` (stacks-varieties Lemma 8.6), and the normalization (`ℙ¹_ℂ`, with `K' = ℂ`) is needed in (a).

### Examples

## Layer 3: Positivity over an arbitrary field

### 3.1 Nef line bundles

Nefness is imported. A line bundle `L` on a proper `K`-scheme `X` is nef if its degree on every integral closed curve `C ⊆ X` is nonnegative (AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.5, over the base `Spec K`). The same section gives stability under sums and positive multiples, nefness of `p^*L` for every `K`-morphism `p : Y → X` of proper `K`-schemes (in particular of `L|_Z` for every closed subscheme `Z`), and preservation of nefness under extension of the ground field; its §1.7 shows that ample line bundles are nef. Nef real classes are those of §2.3: nonnegative degree on every integral curve, equivalently nef image in `N¹(X/K)`. They form a convex cone in `Pic(X) ⊗ ℝ` containing the nef line bundles, which can be strictly larger than the cone of positive combinations of nef line bundles (Checks); every statement here about nef real classes is about the full cone. Prove the following.

- *Numerical form.* `L` is nef if and only if `(L · C) ≥ 0` for every integral closed curve `C ⊆ X`, with the numerical intersection of CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3. On a scheme `C` of dimension one, `χ(C, nL)` is a polynomial of degree at most one in `n`, so its coefficient of `n` is the degree `χ(C, L) − χ(C, O_C)` of AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §0.1. On a projective variety the same condition is the nefness of ArakelovGeometryAndAbelianHeightsPartII §0.1, through SchemeAndStackFoundations §3.3 and §2.2.
- *Big and nef pullback.* If `p : Y → X` is a generically finite surjective morphism of projective varieties of the same dimension `d` and `L` is big and nef, then `p^*L` is big and nef, with `((p^*L)^d) = deg(p)·(L^d)` by the projection formula (CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3).
- *Pullback of nef real classes.* For a `K`-morphism `p : Y → X` of proper `K`-schemes and a nef real class `ω` on `X`, `p^*ω` is nef. For an integral curve `C' ⊆ Y`, the projection formula of §2.3 with `r = 1` gives `(p^*ω · C') = deg(C' → p(C'))·(ω · p(C'))` when `p(C')` is a curve and `0` when it is a point. Consequently, for `p` as in the previous item and a real polarization `ω`, `p^*ω` is a real polarization with `((p^*ω)^d) = deg(p)·(ω^d)`.
- *Ample approximation.* Let `X` be a proper `K`-scheme with an ample line bundle `H`, and `ω_1, …, ω_s` nef real classes written in one finite family of line bundles, `ω_j = Σ_{i=1}^{n} t_{ji} L_i`. Fix an integer `m ≥ 1` such that `mH + L_i` and `mH − L_i` are ample for every `i` (AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.7). For every rational `δ > 0` and all rationals `t'_{ji}` with `|t'_{ji} − t_{ji}| ≤ δ/(2mn)`, there are an integer `N ≥ 1` and ample line bundles `A_1, …, A_s` with `Σ_i t'_{ji} L_i + δH = N^{−1}·A_j` in `Pic(X) ⊗ ℝ`. Consequently, let `P ≤ Q` be an inequality between polynomials in the intersection numbers of `s` classes on closed subschemes of `X`, with `P` and `Q` homogeneous of the same degree in each of the `s` classes. If it holds whenever the classes are ample line bundles, it holds for all nef real classes `ω_1, …, ω_s`.

  *Route.* Ample line bundles have positive degree on integral curves (AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.7), so `|(L_i · C)| < m·(H · C)` for every integral curve `C`. Hence `β_j = Σ_i t'_{ji} L_i + (δ/2)H` has `(β_j · C) ≥ (ω_j · C) − (δ/2)(H · C) + (δ/2)(H · C) ≥ 0`. Let `N ≥ 1` make every `N t'_{ji}` and `Nδ/2` integers, so `Nδ/2 ≥ 1`. Then `Nβ_j + (Nδ/2 − 1)H` is a nef line bundle, and `A_j = Nβ_j + (Nδ/2 − 1)H + H` is ample by AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.7 (ii). For the consequence, `P(N^{−1}A) ≤ Q(N^{−1}A)` follows from `P(A) ≤ Q(A)` by homogeneity. Every intersection number is a polynomial in the coefficients (§2.3), so letting `δ → 0` and `t'_{ji} → t_{ji}` gives `P(ω) ≤ Q(ω)`.
- *Field extension.* Let `K'/K` be a field extension. For every projective `K`-scheme `X`, `L` is nef on `X` if and only if `L_{K'}` is nef on `X_{K'}`. The forward direction is the base change of AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.5 along `Spec K' → Spec K`, both bases being Noetherian. Converse: for an integral curve `C ⊆ X`, `(L · C) = (L_{K'} · C_{K'})` by field-extension compatibility (CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3), `C_{K'}` has pure dimension one, and §2.1 writes `(L_{K'} · C_{K'})` as `Σ m_i (L_{K'} · C_i)` over its components, each term nonnegative.
- *Reduction.* For `V`, `Ṽ`, `K'` and `W` as in §2.4, the pullback to `W` of a nef line bundle on `V` is nef. It is nef on `Ṽ` by pullback. Nefness on `Ṽ` does not depend on whether `Ṽ` is regarded over `K` or over `K'`, since the degree of a line bundle on a curve over `K` is `[K' : K]` times its degree over `K'` (Tau Ceti's `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.LineBundleClass.intersectionNumber_eq_finrank_mul`). It is then nef on `Ṽ_Ω` by the field-extension item over `K'`, and on `W` by pullback along the closed immersion.

*Needs:* AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §§0.1, 1.5, 1.7; ArakelovGeometryAndAbelianHeightsPartII §0.1; CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3; §§2.1–2.4; SchemeAndStackFoundations §3.3; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.LineBundleClass.intersectionNumber_eq_finrank_mul`.

**Checks.**

- `X = ℙ¹_ℂ` as an `ℝ`-scheme with `L = O(1)`: `X_ℂ = ℙ¹_ℂ ⊔ ℙ¹_ℂ` and `L_ℂ` has degree `1` on each component, so it is nef; the converse computes `(L · X) = 2 = 1 + 1` over the two components. In `𝔸²_{K(t)}` the line `y = tx` is an integral curve whose image in `𝔸²_K` is dense, so an integral curve of `X_{K'}` need not lie over a curve of `X`: the forward direction is the imported base-change theorem, not a curve-by-curve comparison.
- On `ℙ¹`, `O(a)` is nef if and only if `a ≥ 0`. On `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹`, `O(a,b)` is nef if and only if `a, b ≥ 0`, since `O(a,b)` has degree `b` on `{p} × ℙ¹` and `a` on `ℙ¹ × {q}`.
- `O(1,0)` on `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹` is nef and not ample: its degree on `{p} × ℙ¹` is `0`. It is the pullback of `O(1)` along the first projection.
- On the blow-up `π : X → ℙ²` of a point, `π^*O(1)` is big and nef with `((π^*O(1))²) = 1 · 1 = 1`. It has degree `0` on the exceptional curve, so it is not ample.
- Non-example: `O(1,−1)` on `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹` has degree `−1` on `{p} × ℙ¹` and is not nef.
- Full nef cone. Let `E` be a complex elliptic curve without complex multiplication, `X = E × E`, `F_1 = {0} × E`, `F_2 = E × {0}` and `Δ` the diagonal: their squares are `0` and their pairwise intersections `1`, so they are independent and span `N¹(X/ℂ)`, of dimension `ρ(E × E) = 3` (AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.2, Checks). Under `xF_1 + yF_2 + zΔ ↦ [[x + z, −z], [−z, y + z]]` the intersection of two classes becomes `tr(B·adj B')`, the polarization of `2·det`, and `F_1 + F_2` goes to the identity. An integral curve on an abelian surface is algebraically equivalent to a translate meeting it properly, so it has nonnegative square; it has positive degree on the ample `F_1 + F_2`, so its matrix is positive semidefinite. Hence a class of this span is nef exactly when its matrix is positive semidefinite: its degree on a curve `C` is `tr(B·adj C) ≥ 0`, and conversely a nef class has nonnegative square (§3.2) and nonnegative trace. This is the identification of AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.4 (Checks). The class `A = (1 + √2)F_1 + (2 + √2)F_2 − √2Δ` has matrix `[[1, √2], [√2, 2]]`, with eigenvalues `0` and `3`. So `A` is nef, with `(A²) = 0`, `(A · (F_1 + F_2)) = 3` and degrees `2`, `1` and `3 + 2√2` on `F_1`, `F_2` and `Δ`. It is no positive combination of nef line bundles. Numerical classes of line bundles have rational matrices, and if `A = Σ a_j B_j` with `a_j > 0` and `B_j` rational positive semidefinite, then `v = (−√2, 1)` has `vᵀAv = 0`, so `vᵀB_jv = 0`, `B_jv = 0` and `B_j = 0`. The ample class `A + F_1 + F_2` is such a combination: it is `(2 − √2)(2F_1 + 2F_2 − Δ) + (√2 − 1)(3F_1 + 6F_2 − 2Δ) + F_1 + (5 − 3√2)F_2`, with nef line bundles of matrices `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]`, `[[1, 2], [2, 4]]`, `[[1, 0], [0, 0]]` and `[[0, 0], [0, 1]]`. Negative control: `F_1 − F_2` has matrix `diag(1, −1)`, square `−2` and degree `−1` on `F_1`, so it is not nef.
- Approximation needs the ample term. On `E × E` as above, with `H = F_1 + F_2`, one may take `m = 3`: `3H ± F_1`, `3H ± F_2` and `3H ± Δ` have positive definite matrices (`[[2, 1], [1, 2]]` for `3H − Δ`), while `2H − Δ` has the singular matrix `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]` and is not ample. Write `A` in the family `F_1, F_2, Δ`, so `n = 3`, and take `δ = 1/5`, a tolerance `δ/(2mn) = 1/90`. The rationals `(2.41, 3.41, −1.42)` lie within `1/90` of `(1 + √2, 2 + √2, −√2)`. Their class alone has matrix `[[0.99, 1.42], [1.42, 1.99]]`, of determinant `−0.0463`, and is not nef: rounding the coefficients of a boundary class can leave the nef cone. With `δH` added the matrix is `[[1.19, 1.42], [1.42, 2.19]]`, of determinant `0.5897`, and `N = 100` gives the ample line bundle `261F_1 + 361F_2 − 142Δ`, of matrix `[[119, 142], [142, 219]]` and determinant `5897`.
- Homogeneity is needed in the consequence: on `ℙ²` the inequality `(A²) ≥ 1` holds for every ample line bundle `A = O(a)`, `a ≥ 1`, but fails for the nef real class `H/2`, of square `1/4`.

### 3.2 Kleiman's theorem

Let `X` be proper over `K`, `Z ⊆ X` a closed subscheme of dimension `r`, and `D_1, …, D_r` nef line bundles on `X`, or nef real classes. Prove `(D_1 ⋯ D_r · Z) ≥ 0` for the numerical intersection. Kleiman's theorem itself, for nef line bundles on an integral closed subscheme and with degrees of first Chern classes, and the ampleness of `D + H` for `D` nef and `H` ample, both over every field, are AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.7 (ii) (lazarsfeld2004 Theorem 1.4.9 and Corollary 1.4.10; cutkosky2015 §2.2, lines 274–287, for the nef and ample cones over an arbitrary field). This subsection adds nonintegral `Z`, the Euler-characteristic numbers and all nef real classes.

*Route.* By §2.1, extended multilinearly to real classes (§2.3), `(D_1 ⋯ D_r · Z) = Σ_i m_i (D_1 ⋯ D_r · Z_i)` over the `r`-dimensional components `Z_i` of `Z`, with `m_i ≥ 1`. For nef line bundles, on each integral `Z_i`, §2.2 identifies `(D_1 ⋯ D_r · Z_i)` with `deg(c_1(D_1) ∩ ⋯ ∩ c_1(D_r) ∩ [Z_i])`, which is nonnegative by AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.7 (ii) applied to `Z_i ⊆ X`. For nef real classes, Chow's lemma (SchemeAndStackFoundations §4.12) gives an integral projective `Z'` with a proper birational `π : Z' → Z_i`, and the projection formula of §2.3, of degree one, gives `(D_1 ⋯ D_r · Z_i) = (π^*D_1 ⋯ π^*D_r)_{Z'}`, where the `π^*D_j` are nef (§3.1). On the projective `Z'` the ample approximation of §3.1 applies to the inequality `0 ≤ (D_1 ⋯ D_r)_{Z'}`, homogeneous of degree one in each class, which holds for ample line bundles by positivity (CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3).

*Needs:* §§2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1; AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §§1.5, 1.7; CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3 (ample positivity); SchemeAndStackFoundations §4.12.

**Checks.**

- On `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹`: `(O(1,0)²) = 0 ≥ 0` and `(O(1,0) · O(0,1)) = 1`.
- Non-example: `(O(1,−1)²) = 2·1·(−1) = −2 < 0`, and `O(1,−1)` is not nef (§3.1).
- Nonintegral support: the double line `Z = V(x²) ⊆ ℙ²` has `χ(O_Z(n)) = χ(O(n)) − χ(O(n − 2)) = 2n + 1`, so `(O(1) · Z) = 2 = 2·(O(1) · line) ≥ 0`. A version on the reduced support alone would give `1`.
- The imported nef-plus-ample: `O(1,0) + O(1,1) = O(2,1)` is ample on `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹`, with `(O(2,1)²) = 4` and degrees `1` and `2` on the rulings. Without the ample summand, `O(1,0)` is nef and not ample.
- On the blow-up of `ℙ²` at a point with exceptional curve `E`, `π^*O(1)` is nef and `(π^*O(1) · E) = 0 ≥ 0`. Adding the ample `π^*O(2) − E` gives the ample `π^*O(3) − E`.
- A nef real class outside the positive combinations of nef line bundles: on `E × E` with the class `A` of §3.1 (Checks), `(A²) = 0 ≥ 0` and `(A · (F_1 + F_2)) = 3 ≥ 0`. A statement restricted to positive combinations of nef line bundles would not cover `A`. The class `F_1 − F_2`, of square `−2`, is not nef.

### 3.3 Siu's inequality in intersection form

Let `V` be an integral projective variety of dimension `r ≥ 1`, `A` and `B` nef line bundles with `(A^r) > 0`, and `C_1, …, C_{r−1}` nef line bundles. Prove

```text
(A^r)·(B · C_1 ⋯ C_{r−1}) ≤ r·(A^{r−1} · B)·(A · C_1 ⋯ C_{r−1}).
```

Prove also that a nef line bundle `A` with `(A^r) > 0` is big. The inequality holds as well when `A`, `B` and the `C_j` are nef real classes with `(A^r) > 0` (dang2020 Proposition 3.4.1 and Remark 3.4.3, lines 840–869; lazarsfeld2004 Theorem 2.2.15; dangfavre2021 Theorem 1.2, line 434, for `k = 1` with constant `d`).

*Route.* Bigness is ArakelovGeometryAndAbelianHeightsPartII §0.3 (1′), read through §2.2. For nef line bundles: for integers `p, q > 0` with `p(A^r) > r q (A^{r−1}·B)`, §0.3 (2′) gives `vol(pA − qB) ≥ p^{r−1}(p(A^r) − rq(A^{r−1}·B)) > 0`. So some `m(pA − qB)` has a nonzero section. On the integral `V` it is a regular section, and its zero scheme is an effective Cartier divisor `D` (Tau Ceti's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData.IsEffectiveCartier`) with `O(D) ≅ m(pA − qB)`. The Cartier restriction formula and §3.2 on `D` give `m(p(A · C) − q(B · C)) = (C_1 ⋯ C_{r−1} · D) ≥ 0`. Let `p/q` decrease to `r(A^{r−1}·B)/(A^r)`. For nef real classes: both sides are homogeneous of degree `r` in `A` and of degree one in `B` and in each `C_j`, and the inequality holds for ample line bundles by the case just proved, so the ample approximation of §3.1 extends it to all nef real classes on `V`.

*Needs:* §§2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2; ArakelovGeometryAndAbelianHeightsPartII §0.3; CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3 (Cartier restriction); Tau Ceti `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData.IsEffectiveCartier`.

**Checks.**

- On `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹`, write `(a,b)·(c,d) = ad + bc`. With `A = O(1,1)`, `B = O(1,0)` and `C = O(0,1)`: `(A²)(B·C) = 2·1 = 2` and `2(A·B)(A·C) = 2·1·1 = 2`, so equality holds. With `C = O(1,0)` instead: `0 ≤ 2`.
- `r = 1`: both sides are `(A)·(B)`.
- Non-example: `B = O(1,−1)` is not nef. With `A = O(1,1)` and `C = O(0,1)`, the left side is `2·1 = 2` but the right side is `2·0·1 = 0`. Nefness of `B` is needed.
- Nef real classes on `E × E`: write `A_0` for the boundary class `A` of the §3.1 Checks and `I = F_1 + F_2`. Take `A = A_0 + I`, of matrix `[[2, √2], [√2, 3]]` and square `8`, `B = A_0`, which is no positive combination of nef line bundles, and `C = I`. The left side is `8·(A_0·I) = 8·3 = 24` and the right side `2·((A_0 + I)·A_0)·((A_0 + I)·I) = 2·3·5 = 30`.

### 3.4 The Hodge inequality on surfaces

Let `S` be an integral projective surface over `K`, `H` a line bundle with `(H²) > 0`, and `D` any line bundle. Prove `(D · H)² ≥ (D²)·(H²)`. No positivity of `H` is assumed (kleiman2005 Theorem B.27, line 3803, the Hodge index theorem on a geometrically irreducible complete surface over a field for every `H` with `(H²) > 0`, proved there by another route; cutkosky2015 lines 994–1003).

*Route.* By §2.4 reduce to `S` integral over an algebraically closed `Ω`: both sides scale by `c_S²`, and `((H|_W)²) = (H²)/c_S > 0`. de Jong's theorem (SchemeAndStackFoundations §4.19) gives an alteration `φ : S' → S` from a regular projective surface. Since `φ` is proper, `S'` is the component of the regular compactification containing it. `S'` is smooth over `Ω` (SchemeAndStackFoundations §4.13, `Ω` perfect). Let `δ` be the generic degree and `H' = φ^*H`, so `(H'²) = δ(H²) > 0` by the projection formula (§2.3). The Hodge index theorem of SchemeAndStackFoundations §5.10, read through §2.2, applies to `H'` on the smooth projective integral `S'` directly, since it assumes only `(H'²) > 0`. Apply it to the line bundle `D'' = (H'²)·φ^*D − (φ^*D · H')·H'`, which has `(D'' · H') = 0`: `(D''²) = (H'²)·((H'²)·((φ^*D)²) − (φ^*D · H')²) ≤ 0`, so `(φ^*D · H')² ≥ ((φ^*D)²)·(H'²)`. Divide by `δ²`, using the projection formula (§2.3). What this section adds to the smooth case is the reduction from an integral, possibly singular surface over an arbitrary field.

*Needs:* §§2.2, 2.3, 2.4; SchemeAndStackFoundations §§4.13, 4.19, 5.10.

**Checks.**

- On `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹` with `H = O(1,1)`: `D = O(1,−1)` gives `0 ≥ (−2)·2 = −4`; `D = H` gives equality `4 = 4`.
- On the quadric cone `Q ⊆ ℙ³`, a singular normal surface, `H = D = O(1)` gives `(D·H)² = 4 = 2·2`.
- On the blow-up of `ℙ²` at a point with `L = π^*O(1)` and exceptional curve `E`, `H = 2L + E` has `(H²) = 4 − 1 = 3 > 0` and `(H · E) = −1`, so `H` is not nef. `D = E` gives `(D·H)² = 1 ≥ (−1)·3 = −3`, and `D = L` gives `4 ≥ 1·3`. A statement restricted to nef `H` would not cover this instance, and the perturbation of `H` to an ample class, which needs `H` nef, is not a route to it.
- Non-example: on the blow-up of `ℙ²` at two points with exceptional curves `E_1`, `E_2`, take `H = E_1` with `(H²) = −1` and `D = E_2`. Then `(D·H)² = 0 < 1 = (D²)(H²)`. The hypothesis `(H²) > 0` is needed.

### 3.5 The Khovanskii–Teissier inequalities

Let `V` be an integral projective variety of dimension `d ≥ 2` and `A, B, C_1, …, C_{d−2}` nef line bundles or nef real classes. Prove the inequality of Hodge type

```text
(A · B · C_1 ⋯ C_{d−2})² ≥ (A² · C_1 ⋯ C_{d−2})·(B² · C_1 ⋯ C_{d−2}).
```

As a consequence, for nef `A, B` and `s_k = (A^k · B^{d−k})`, prove `s_k² ≥ s_{k−1}·s_{k+1}` for `1 ≤ k ≤ d − 1` (lazarsfeld2004 Theorem 1.6.1 and Corollary 1.6.3; cutkosky2015 Theorem 6.1 and Corollary 6.3, lines 983–1033, over an arbitrary field; guedj2010 Théorème 2.4 (a), line 1180, and dangfavre2021 lines 464–467 for the use on dynamical degrees). The consequence is the main inequality with `C_1 ⋯ C_{d−2} = A^{k−1}B^{d−k−1}`.

*Route.* Both sides are homogeneous of degree two in each class, so by the ample approximation of §3.1 it suffices to treat ample line bundles `A, B, C_1, …, C_{d−2}`. By §2.4 reduce to the integral `W` over an algebraically closed `Ω`; both sides scale by `c_V²`, and the pullbacks remain ample (§2.4 (c)). By homogeneity again, replace every class by a very ample multiple (AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry §1.4). Over the purely transcendental extension `Ω(u)`, `W_{Ω(u)}` is integral and geometrically irreducible. Cut it successively by the generic members of the linear systems of `C_1, …, C_{d−2}`. By Bertini irreducibility (LefschetzPencilsAndVanishingCycles §5.1, with `s = 1`, applied while the dimension is at least `3`) each cut has geometrically irreducible support. The last one is a surface `S` with `[cut] = μ[S_red]`. The Cartier restriction formula and field-extension compatibility (CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3), with §2.1, turn the three numbers into `μ` times numbers on `S_red`. Apply §3.4 on `S_red` with `H = A|_S`, which is ample with `(A² · S_red) > 0`. For `d = 2` there is no cut, and the statement for ample line bundles is §3.4 with `H = A`.

*Needs:* §§2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.4; AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.7; AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry §1.4; LefschetzPencilsAndVanishingCycles §5.1; CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3; Tau Ceti `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData.IsEffectiveCartier`.

**Checks.**

- On `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹`: `A = O(1,0)`, `B = O(0,1)` gives `1 ≥ 0·0`; `A = O(2,1)`, `B = O(1,1)` gives `9 ≥ 4·2 = 8`.
- On `ℙ^d` with `A = aH` and `B = bH`, `s_k = a^k b^{d−k}` and log-concavity is an equality.
- Irrational boundary (§3.1, Checks): on `E × E` with the nef class `A` and `I = F_1 + F_2`, `(A · I)² = 9 ≥ (A²)(I²) = 0·2 = 0`. For the ample `A + εI`, `ε > 0`, the two sides are `(3 + 2ε)²` and `(6ε + 2ε²)·2 = 12ε + 4ε²`, which differ by `9` for every `ε` and tend to `9` and `0`, the values at `A`.
- Non-example (cutkosky2015 Remark 6.2, lines 1014–1020): on `ℙ² ⊔ ℙ²`, `α_1 = (O(2), O(1))` and `α_2 = (O(1), O(2))` are ample. They have `(α_1 · α_2)² = 16 < 25 = (α_1²)(α_2²)`, so integrality of `V` is needed.

### 3.6 Siu's inequality for products

Let `V` be an integral projective variety of dimension `r ≥ 1` and `1 ≤ i ≤ r`. Let `A_1, …, A_i`, `B`, `C_1, …, C_{r−i}` be nef line bundles or nef real classes with `(B^r) > 0`. Prove

```text
(B^r)·(A_1 ⋯ A_i · C_1 ⋯ C_{r−i}) ≤ (r − i + 1)^i·(A_1 ⋯ A_i · B^{r−i})·(B^i · C_1 ⋯ C_{r−i}).
```

As a consequence, if `A` and `B` are nef with `(A^r) > 0` and `(B^r) > 0`, then `(A^k · B^{r−k}) > 0` for every `0 ≤ k ≤ r`. To see this, take `A_j = A` and `C_j = A`: the left side is `(B^r)(A^r) > 0` (dang2020 Theorem 3, line 141, and Theorem 3.4.4 with its proof, lines 871–883; dangfavre2021 Theorem 1.2, lines 427–433).

*Route.* Both sides are homogeneous of degree `r` in `B` and of degree one in each `A_j` and each `C_j`. So by the ample approximation of §3.1 it suffices to treat ample line bundles, for which `(B^r) > 0` holds automatically. By §2.4 reduce to the integral `W` over an algebraically closed `Ω`; both sides scale by `c_V²`, and the pullbacks remain ample (§2.4 (c)). By homogeneity again, replace `B` and the `A_j` by very ample multiples (AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry §1.4). For `j = 1, …, i`, let `Z_j` be the reduced support of the generic complete intersection representing `B^{j−1} · A_{j+1} ⋯ A_i ∩ [W]`, over a purely transcendental extension of `Ω`. It has dimension `r − i + 1`, irreducible support by LefschetzPencilsAndVanishingCycles §5.1, and some multiplicity. Apply §3.3 on `Z_j` with `A := B`, `B := A_j` and the `C`'s:

```text
x_j ≤ (r − i + 1)·(y_j / y_{j+1})·x_{j+1},
```

where `x_j = (B^{j−1} A_j ⋯ A_i · C)`, `y_j = (B^{r−i+j−1} A_j ⋯ A_i)` and `y_{i+1} = (B^r)`. The denominators are positive by positivity for ample line bundles. The ratios telescope to `y_1/(B^r)`. Reducible supports are excluded because the inequality fails on them (Checks).

*Needs:* §§2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.3; AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometryPartII §1.7; AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry §1.4; LefschetzPencilsAndVanishingCycles §5.1; CyclotomicClassGroupsAndStickelberger §4.3.

**Checks.**

- On `(ℙ¹)³` with fibre classes `h_1, h_2, h_3` and `B = h_1 + h_2 + h_3`, so `(B³) = 6`, take `A_1 = h_1`, `A_2 = h_2`, `C = h_3`. The left side is `6·1 = 6` and the right side is `(3 − 2 + 1)²·(h_1 h_2 B)·(B² h_3) = 4·1·2 = 8`. With the constant `binom(3,2) = 3` the two sides are equal. A constant `1` would give `2 < 6`.
- `i = r`: both sides equal `(B^r)(A_1 ⋯ A_r)`. `i = 1` is §3.3.
- Non-example: on `V = ℙ² ⊔ ℙ²`, take `B = (O(1), O(2))` with `(B²) = 5`, and `A_1 = C = (O(1), O)`. The left side is `5·1 = 5` and the right side `2·1·1 = 2`. The inequality fails on reducible schemes, so the slices `Z_j` must be irreducible.

## Layer 4: Degrees of dominant rational maps

Throughout, `X`, `Y` (and `X_1, X_2, X_3`) are projective varieties of the same dimension `d ≥ 1` and the rational maps are dominant.

### 4.1 Mixed degrees and their models

For `f : X ⤏ Y`, line bundles or real classes `L_1, …, L_{d−k}` on `X` and `M_1, …, M_k` on `Y`, define the *mixed degree*

```text
deg(f; L_1, …, L_{d−k} | M_1, …, M_k) = (π_1^*L_1 ⋯ π_1^*L_{d−k} · π_2^*M_1 ⋯ π_2^*M_k)_{Γ_f},
```

and `deg_k(f; L, M)` with all `L_i = L` and all `M_j = M`. For a self-map put `deg_{k,ω}(f) = deg_k(f; ω, ω)` (dang2020 lines 21–25; dangfavre2021 §1.3, lines 436–443; dinhsibony2005 lines 61–63; russakovskiishiffman1997 lines 499–505). Prove:

- *Model independence.* Let `Γ'` be an integral projective `K`-scheme of dimension `d` with morphisms `q_1 : Γ' → X` and `q_2 : Γ' → Y`. Suppose `q_1` is generically finite and surjective of generic degree `e`, and the rational map of `q_2` is `f ∘ q_1`. Then `(q_1^*L_1 ⋯ q_2^*M_k)_{Γ'} = e·deg(f; L | M)`. The proof factors `(q_1, q_2)` through `Γ_f` and applies the projection formula. In particular, the normalization of `Γ_f` and every proper birational model of `Γ_f` compute the same numbers (dangfavre2021 lines 442–443).
- *Product formula.* `deg(f; L | M) = (pr_1^*L_1 ⋯ pr_2^*M_k · Γ_f)` on `X ×_K Y`.
- *Pullback of cycles.* For line bundles `M_1, …, M_k` on `Y` put `f^*(M_1 ⋯ M_k) = π_{1*}(c_1(π_2^*M_1) ∩ ⋯ ∩ c_1(π_2^*M_k) ∩ [Γ_f]) ∈ CH_{d−k}(X)`. For line bundles `L_1, …, L_{d−k}` on `X`, `deg(f; L | M) = deg(c_1(L_1) ∩ ⋯ ∩ c_1(L_{d−k}) ∩ f^*(M_1 ⋯ M_k))`, by the projection formula of SchemeAndStackFoundations §5.3 and §2.2 (dangfavre2021 footnote 4, lines 452–453; fulton1998 Theorem 1.4 and Proposition 2.5 for proper pushforward of cycles and the first Chern class operation with its projection formula, cited by locator).
- *Pullback of cycles with real coefficients.* For a proper `K`-scheme `T` put `CH_*(T)_ℝ = CH_*(T) ⊗_ℤ ℝ`. Since `c_1(L ⊗ M) ∩ α = c_1(L) ∩ α + c_1(M) ∩ α` (SchemeAndStackFoundations §5.3), `L ↦ c_1(L) ∩ −` is a homomorphism from `Pic(T)` to the endomorphisms of `CH_*(T)`; it extends `ℝ`-linearly to an action of `Pic(T) ⊗ ℝ` on `CH_*(T)_ℝ`, and proper pushforward and the degree of zero-cycles extend `ℝ`-linearly. For real classes `M_j` on `Y` define `f^*(M_1 ⋯ M_k) ∈ CH_{d−k}(X)_ℝ` by the same formula, on `T = Γ_f` and pushed forward to `X`. It is multilinear and symmetric, and for line bundles it is the image of the integral cycle. For real classes `L_i` and `M_j` the degree formula holds with the extended degree on `CH_0(X)_ℝ`: expand both sides multilinearly, and apply the integral formula, with commutativity of first Chern classes, to each term. The integral Chow group cannot carry it, since a zero-cycle with integer coefficients has integer degree while `deg(f; L | M)` can be irrational.
- The mixed degree is multilinear in the `L_i` and the `M_j`, and symmetric within each group.

- `deg_k(id_X; L, M) = (L^{d−k} · M^k)_X`, since `Γ_{id}` is the diagonal.
- Coefficients of the cycle pullback: for `X = Y = ℙ¹`, `f = id`, `k = 1` and `M = O(1)`, `f^*(M)` is the class of a point, of degree `1`. For the real class `M = √2·O(1)` it is `√2·[point] ∈ CH_0(ℙ¹)_ℝ`, of degree `√2 = deg_1(id; −, M)`; no element of `CH_0(ℙ¹) ≅ ℤ` has that degree. For `M = 0` it is `0`.
- For `f(z) = z²` on `ℙ¹` and `H = O(1)`: `deg_{0,H} = 1` and `deg_{1,H} = 2`. The model `Γ' = ℙ¹` with `q_1 = id` and `q_2 = f` gives the same values with `e = 1`. The model `q_1 = f`, `q_2 = f ∘ f` gives `(f^*H) = 2 = 2·1` for `k = 0`, so `e = 2` multiplies.
- For the Cremona involution of `ℙ²`, the product formula computes `deg_{1,H}(σ)` as `(pr_1^*H · pr_2^*H · Γ_σ) = 2`, where `Γ_σ` is the blow-up at three points.

### 4.2 Values, integrality and positivity

Let `f : X ⤏ Y` and `L`, `M` be line bundles or real classes. Prove:

- `deg_0(f; L, M) = (L^d)_X` and `deg_d(f; L, M) = e(f)·(M^d)_Y`.
- If `f` is a morphism, `deg_k(f; L, M) = (L^{d−k} · (f^*M)^k)_X`. If `X = Y`, `ω` is a line bundle with `(ω^d) ≠ 0`, and `f^*ω ≅ qω` for an integer `q ≥ 1`, then `deg_{k,ω}(f) = q^k(ω^d)` and `e(f) = q^d`.
- `deg_k(f; L, M)` is an integer when `L` and `M` are line bundles.
- If `L` and `M` are nef, then `deg_k(f; L, M) ≥ 0`. It is monotone: if `L`, `M`, `L' − L` and `M' − M` are nef real classes, then `deg_k(f; L, M) ≤ deg_k(f; L', M')`.
- *Positivity.* If `L` and `M` are big and nef, or real polarizations, then `deg_k(f; L, M) > 0` for every `0 ≤ k ≤ d`.

`deg_0` uses that `π_1` is birational; `deg_d` that `π_2` is an alteration of generic degree `e(f)`; the polarized case compares `deg_d` with `e(f)(ω^d)`. Positivity applies §3.6 on `Γ_f` to the nef classes `π_1^*L` and `π_2^*M`, whose top powers are `(L^d) > 0` and `e(f)(M^d) > 0` (§3.1). Nonnegativity is §3.2 on `Γ_f`. For monotonicity write `L' = L + P` and `M' = M + Q` and expand multilinearly: every term is a mixed degree of the nef classes `L, P, M, Q`, nonnegative by §3.2, and one term is `deg_k(f; L, M)` (dangfavre2021 footnote 5, line 454, for integrality; russakovskiishiffman1997 lines 506–511 for `δ_n` as the topological degree and `δ_ℓ = (deg P)^ℓ` for morphisms).

*Needs:* §§1.1, 1.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.6, 4.1.

- The Cremona involution of `ℙ²` has `(deg_{0,H}, deg_{1,H}, deg_{2,H}) = (1, 2, 1)`.
- The Frobenius `F` of `ℙ^d` in characteristic `p` has `F^*H ≅ pH`, so `deg_{k,H}(F) = p^k` and `e(F) = p^d`.
- Non-example: on `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹` with `f = id` and the nef, not big `ω = O(1,0)`, `deg_{1,ω}(id) = (ω²) = 0`. Bigness is needed for positivity.
- The real polarization `ω = O(1,0) + O(0,1)` on `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹`, neither summand big, has `deg_{1,ω}(id) = (ω²) = 2 > 0`.
- Non-example for monotonicity: on `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹` with `f = id`, `k = 1`, `L = M = O(1,1)` and the nef `L' = M' = 1.5·O(1,0) + 0.5·O(0,1)`, the degree drops from `2` to `2·1.5·0.5 = 1.5`. Here `L' − L = 0.5·O(1,0) − 0.5·O(0,1)` has degree `−0.5` on a ruling and is not nef.
- Monotonicity with a nef real class that is no positive combination of nef line bundles: on `E × E` with the class `A` and `I = F_1 + F_2` of the §3.1 Checks, `deg_1(id; A, A) = (A²) = 0 ≤ deg_1(id; A, A + I) = 3 ≤ deg_1(id; A + I, A + I) = 8`.

### 4.3 Invariance under normalization and extension of the field

- *Normalization.* For `ν : X̃ → X` the normalization and `f̃ = ν^{−1} ∘ f ∘ ν` (§1.4), `deg_k(f̃; ν^*L, ν^*M) = deg_k(f; L, M)`. This is model independence through the birational `Γ_{f̃} → Γ_f`. If `L` is ample, big and nef, or a real polarization, so is `ν^*L`.
- *Extension of the field.* For every field extension `K'/K`, `deg_k(f; L, M)` equals `(pr_1^*L_{K'}^{d−k} · pr_2^*M_{K'}^k · (Γ_f)_{K'})` computed over `K'` on the base-changed graph with its fundamental cycle. If `X` and `Y` are geometrically integral, it equals `deg_k(f_{K'}; L_{K'}, M_{K'})` (dang2020 lines 18–20; truong2020 §6.3, lines 1529–1533).

- `X = ℙ¹_ℂ` over `ℝ`, `f = id`, `ω = O(1)`: `deg_{1,ω} = 2` over `ℝ`. The base change of `Γ_{id}` is two diagonals over `ℂ`, each contributing `1`.
- The cuspidal cubic `X = V(y²z − x³)` with `ω = O(1)|_X` has `ν^*ω = O(3)` on `ℙ¹`. For `f = id`, `deg_0 = 3` on both sides.
- The Cremona involution over `ℚ` and over `ℂ` both have degrees `(1, 2, 1)`.

### 4.4 Sub-multiplicativity

Let `f_1 : X_1 ⤏ X_2` and `f_2 : X_2 ⤏ X_3` be dominant, `0 ≤ k ≤ d`, and `L_j` nef line bundles or nef real classes on `X_j`, with `L_2` big and nef or a real polarization. Prove

```text
deg_k(f_2 ∘ f_1; L_1, L_3) ≤ ((d − k + 1)^k / (L_2^d))·deg_k(f_1; L_1, L_2)·deg_k(f_2; L_2, L_3).
```

For a self-map and a polarization `ω` this gives `deg_{k,ω}(g ∘ f) ≤ C_k(ω)·deg_{k,ω}(f)·deg_{k,ω}(g)` with `C_k(ω) = (d − k + 1)^k/(ω^d)`. No normality is assumed (dang2020 Theorem 1 (i), lines 27–30, and Theorem 5.2.1 with its proof, lines 1271–1358, for normal varieties over an algebraically closed field; dangfavre2021 Theorem 1.3, lines 448–451; truong2020 Theorem 1.1 (1), lines 143–158; dinhsibony2005 Proposition 6, lines 245–247, over `ℂ`; silverman2014 (3), line 387, for `k = 1` on `ℙ^N`).

*Route.* Let `W = W_{f_1,f_2}` (§1.3). Apply §3.6 on `W` with `i = k`, `B = q_2^*L_2`, `A_j = q_3^*L_3` and `C_j = q_1^*L_1`; here `(B^d) = e(f_1)(L_2^d) > 0`. By model independence:

- `(A^k C^{d−k}) = deg_k(f_2 ∘ f_1; L_1, L_3)`;
- `(A^k B^{d−k}) = e(f_1)·deg_k(f_2; L_2, L_3)`;
- `(B^k C^{d−k}) = deg_k(f_1; L_1, L_2)`.

Divide by `e(f_1)(L_2^d)`. For `k = 0` and `k = d` the inequality is an equality, by §4.2 and multiplicativity of `e`.

*Needs:* §§1.1, 1.3, 3.1, 3.6, 4.1, 4.2.

**Checks.**

- `f_1 = f_2 = (z ↦ z²)` on `ℙ¹`, `d = k = 1`: `4 ≤ (1/1)·2·2 = 4`, equality.
- Cremona on `ℙ²`, `k = 1`: `deg_{1,H}(σ ∘ σ) = 1 ≤ (2/1)·2·2 = 8`.
- Morphisms of degrees `a, b` on `ℙ^d`: `(ab)^k ≤ (d − k + 1)^k a^k b^k`.
- `k = d` with `f_1 = Frobenius` and `f_2 = (z ↦ z²)` on `ℙ¹` in characteristic `p`: `2p = (1/1)·p·2`, equality.
- Nef real inputs outside the positive combinations of nef line bundles: on `E × E` with `f_1 = f_2 = id`, `k = 1`, `L_1 = L_3 = A` and `L_2 = I = F_1 + F_2` (§3.1, Checks), the left side is `(A²) = 0` and the right side `(2/(I²))·(A · I)·(I · A) = (2/2)·3·3 = 9`.

### 4.5 Comparison of polarizations and birational conjugacy

- *Comparison.* Let `ω, ω'` be real polarizations on `X` and `0 ≤ k ≤ d`. There is `C ≥ 1` with `C^{−1}·deg_{k,ω}(f) ≤ deg_{k,ω'}(f) ≤ C·deg_{k,ω}(f)` for every dominant `f : X ⤏ X`. One may take `C = (d − k + 1)^{2k}·max(c(ω, ω'), c(ω', ω))` with `c(ω, ω') = (ω'^{d−k}ω^k)·(ω^{d−k}ω'^k)/(ω^d)²`; it depends on `ω`, `ω'`, `d` and `k`, not on `f`.
- *Birational conjugacy.* Let `φ : X ⤏ Y` be birational and `ω_X`, `ω_Y` real polarizations. There is `C ≥ 1` with `C^{−1}·deg_{k,ω_X}(f) ≤ deg_{k,ω_Y}(φ ∘ f ∘ φ^{−1}) ≤ C·deg_{k,ω_X}(f)` for all dominant `f : X ⤏ X`. Moreover `(φ ∘ f ∘ φ^{−1})^n = φ ∘ f^n ∘ φ^{−1}`, using §1.1 to show `φ^{−1} ∘ φ = id`.

*Route.* §4.4 applied twice, once on each side, with the identity or `φ^{±1}` as the outer maps; it applies to real polarizations, which are nef real classes with positive top power. For the comparison, write `f = id ∘ f ∘ id` with the polarizations `ω'`, `ω`, `ω`, `ω'` on the four copies of `X`. This gives `deg_{k,ω'}(f) ≤ C_1·deg_{k,ω}(f)` with `C_1 = (d − k + 1)^{2k}·c(ω, ω')`, and exchanging `ω` and `ω'` gives `deg_{k,ω}(f) ≤ C_2·deg_{k,ω'}(f)` with `C_2 = (d − k + 1)^{2k}·c(ω', ω)`. For `f = id` these read `(ω'^d) ≤ C_1(ω^d)` and `(ω^d) ≤ C_2(ω'^d)`, so `C_1C_2 ≥ 1` and `C = max(C_1, C_2) ≥ 1`. The constants `deg_k(id; ω', ω) = (ω'^{d−k}ω^k)` are positive by §4.2 (dang2020 Theorem 1 (ii), lines 31–41; dangfavre2021 Theorem 1.3, second item, lines 457–460; dinhsibony2005 Corollaire 7, lines 256–263).

*Needs:* §§1.1, 2.3, 4.2, 4.4; Mathlib `Scheme.PartialIso.symm`, `Scheme.RationalMap.comp_assoc`.

**Checks.**

- On `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹` with the swap `τ(x, y) = (y, x)`: `deg_{1,O(1,1)}(τ) = (O(1,1)·O(1,1)) = 2` and `deg_{1,O(2,1)}(τ) = (O(2,1)·O(1,2)) = 5`. With `ω = O(1,1)` and `ω' = O(2,1)`: `(ω·ω') = 3`, `(ω²) = 2`, `(ω'²) = 4`. So `c(ω, ω') = 9/4` and `c(ω', ω) = 9/16`, and `C = 2²·9/4 = 9`. The ratio `5/2` lies in `[1/9, 9]`.
- For `d = 1`, `deg_{1,ω}(f) = e(f)·(ω)` exactly, and conjugacy by an automorphism of `ℙ¹` preserves `e`.
- Conjugating the Cremona involution of `ℙ²` by a linear automorphism leaves `deg_{1,H} = 2`.
- Real polarizations on `E × E` (§3.1, Checks): `ω = F_1 + F_2` and `ω' = A + F_1 + F_2`, of squares `2` and `8` and product `5`, give `c(ω, ω') = 25/4`, `c(ω', ω) = 25/64` and `C = 25`. The swap `τ` of the factors exchanges `F_1` and `F_2` and fixes `Δ`; `deg_{1,ω}(τ) = 2` and `deg_{1,ω'}(τ) = (ω'·τ^*ω') = 2·2 + 3·3 − 2·√2·√2 = 9`, within the factor `25` of each other.

## Layer 5: Dynamical degrees and algebraic entropy

Throughout, `X` is a projective variety of dimension `d ≥ 1`, `f : X ⤏ X` is dominant, and `ω` is a real polarization.

### 5.1 Existence

For `0 ≤ k ≤ d`, prove that `deg_{k,ω}(f^n)^{1/n}` converges as `n → ∞`. Call the limit `λ_k(f)`. Prove that it equals `inf_{n ≥ 1} (C_k(ω)·deg_{k,ω}(f^n))^{1/n}` with `C_k(ω) = (d − k + 1)^k/(ω^d)` (dangfavre2021 lines 461–465; dang2020 lines 42–46; dinhsibony2005 Corollaire 7, lines 256–259; silverman2014 Proposition 7, lines 383–413).

*Route.* By §4.4, `u_n = log(C_k(ω)·deg_{k,ω}(f^n))` satisfies `u_{m+n} ≤ u_m + u_n`, using `f^{m+n} = f^m ∘ f^n` (Mathlib's `Scheme.RationalMap.comp_assoc`). The logarithm is defined by §4.2. Fix an ample line bundle `H` on `X`. By §4.5 there is `C ≥ 1`, independent of `n`, with `deg_{k,ω}(f^n) ≥ C^{−1}·deg_{k,H}(f^n) ≥ C^{−1}`, since `deg_{k,H}(f^n)` is a positive integer (§4.2). So `u_n ≥ log(C_k(ω)/C)` and `u_n/n ≥ min(0, log(C_k(ω)/C))` for `n ≥ 1`, which also covers the value `u_0/0 = 0`. Mathlib's `Subadditive.tendsto_lim` and `Subadditive.lim` (the infimum of `u_n/n` over `n ≥ 1`) give convergence to the infimum. Since `C_k(ω)^{1/n} → 1`, the limit is also `lim deg_{k,ω}(f^n)^{1/n}`.

*Needs:* §§4.2, 4.4, 4.5; Mathlib `Subadditive`, `Subadditive.tendsto_lim`, `Subadditive.lim`, `Subadditive.lim_le_div`, `Scheme.RationalMap.comp`, `Scheme.RationalMap.comp_assoc`.

**Checks.**

- A morphism `f` of `ℙ^d` of degree `a` has `deg_{k,H}(f^n) = a^{nk}`, so `λ_k = a^k`. For `1 ≤ k ≤ d − 1` the infimum `inf_n ((d − k + 1)^k a^{nk})^{1/n} = a^k` is approached as `n → ∞` and not attained at `n = 1`, where the value is `(d − k + 1)^k a^k > a^k`. For `k = 0` and `k = d` the constant `(d − k + 1)^k` is `1`, the sequence is constantly `1` or `a^d`, and the infimum is attained at `n = 1`.
- For the Cremona involution of `ℙ²`, `deg_{1,H}(σ^n)` is `2` for odd `n` and `1` for even `n`, so `λ_1(σ) = 1`.
- For the Fibonacci map of §6.3, `fib(n + 2)^{1/n} → Real.goldenRatio`.

### 5.2 Properties

Prove:

- `λ_k(f) ∈ [1, ∞)`.
- `λ_k(f)` does not depend on the real polarization `ω`, by §4.5.
- `λ_k(f^m) = λ_k(f)^m` for `m ≥ 1`, along the subsequence `n·m`.
- `λ_0(f) = 1` and `λ_d(f) = e(f)`, by §4.2 and multiplicativity of `e`: `deg_{d,ω}(f^n) = e(f)^n·(ω^d)`.
- *Log-concavity.* `λ_k(f)² ≥ λ_{k−1}(f)·λ_{k+1}(f)` for `1 ≤ k ≤ d − 1`. This is §3.5 on `Γ_{f^n}` with `A = π_2^*ω` and `B = π_1^*ω`, followed by `n`-th roots.
- As a consequence of log-concavity and `λ_0 = 1`, `λ_k(f) ≤ λ_1(f)^k`.

*Needs:* §§1.1, 3.5, 4.2, 4.5, 5.1.

**Checks.**

- The Fibonacci map has `(λ_0, λ_1, λ_2) = (1, Real.goldenRatio, 1)` with `Real.goldenRatio² = Real.goldenRatio + 1 ≈ 2.618 ≥ 1`.
- The Frobenius of `ℙ^d` has `λ_k = p^k`, so log-concavity is an equality and `λ_d = p^d = e`. A separable-degree convention for `λ_d` would give `1`, contradicting `deg_{d,H}(F^n) = p^{nd}`.
- The Cremona involution has `λ_k = 1` for all `k`. The squaring map of `ℙ¹` has `(λ_0, λ_1) = (1, 2)`.

### 5.3 Invariance

Prove:

- *Birational conjugacy.* `λ_k(φ ∘ f ∘ φ^{−1}) = λ_k(f)` for every birational `φ : X ⤏ Y` to a projective variety `Y`, by §4.5.
- *Normalization.* `λ_k(f̃) = λ_k(f)` for the normalization lift `f̃` of §1.4.
- *Extension of the field.* If `X` is geometrically integral, `λ_k(f_{K'}) = λ_k(f)` for every field extension `K'/K`. In general `λ_k(f)` is computed by the numbers of §4.3 on the base-changed graphs `(Γ_{f^n})_{K'}`.

*Needs:* §§1.4, 4.3, 4.5, 5.1.

**Checks.**

- Conjugating the Cremona involution by a linear automorphism of `ℙ²` gives `λ_1 = 1`.
- For the cuspidal cubic and `f = id`, `λ_k = 1` on `X` and on `ℙ¹`.
- For `ℙ¹_ℂ` over `ℝ` and the identity, `λ_1 = 1` over `ℝ` and over `ℂ`.

### 5.4 Algebraic entropy

Define `h_alg(f) = log max_{0 ≤ k ≤ d} λ_k(f)`. Prove:

- `h_alg(f) ≥ 0`.
- `h_alg` is invariant under birational conjugacy and normalization, and under extension of the field when `X` is geometrically integral.
- `h_alg(f^n) = n·h_alg(f)`.
- `log e(f) ≤ h_alg(f) ≤ d·log λ_1(f)`.
- By log-concavity, the indices `k` where the maximum is attained form an interval.

(dinhsibony2005 Théorème 1, lines 33–37, where `lov(f) = max log λ_l` bounds the topological entropy over `ℂ`; guedj2010 Théorème 2.4, lines 1178–1181.)

*Needs:* §§5.2, 5.3.

**Checks.**

- A morphism of `ℙ^d` of degree `a ≥ 1` has `h_alg = d·log a`, attained at `k = d`.
- The Cremona involution has `h_alg = 0`.
- The Fibonacci map has `h_alg = log Real.goldenRatio ≈ 0.4812`, attained at `k = 1` only.
- The Frobenius of `ℙ^d` has `h_alg = d·log p`.

### 6.1 Rational self-maps of projective space given by forms

Prove:

- *Forms define rational maps.* For forms `F_0, …, F_d ∈ K[x_0, …, x_d]` of a common degree `a ≥ 0`, not all zero, there is a unique `K`-rational map `[F_0 : ⋯ : F_d] : ℙ^d ⤏ ℙ^d` whose restriction to the complement of `V(F_0, …, F_d)` is the morphism given by the line bundle `O(a)` and its generating sections (stacks-constructions Lemma 13.1, tag 01NE, line 1267).
- *Every rational map is given by reduced forms.* Every `K`-rational map `f : ℙ^d ⤏ ℙ^d` is `[F_0 : ⋯ : F_d]` for forms without common factor, unique up to a common nonzero scalar. Their common degree is the *degree* `deg f`. The domain of `f` is exactly the complement of `V(F_0, …, F_d)`, which has codimension `≥ 2`.
- *Composition.* Let `f = [F]` be dominant and `g = [G]` any rational map, both by reduced forms. The tuple `G(F) = (G_0(F), …, G_d(F))` is not identically zero: otherwise the image of `f` would lie in the proper closed subset `V(G_0, …, G_d)`, against dominance. Then `g ∘ f = [G(F)/h]` with `h = gcd_i G_i(F)`, so `deg(g ∘ f) ≤ deg f·deg g`. Equality holds if `g` is a morphism, or if `f` is a morphism.
- *Iterates of morphisms.* A morphism `f = [F]` of `ℙ^d`, that is `V(F_0, …, F_d) = ∅`, of degree `a ≥ 1` is finite and surjective, hence dominant, and its iterates in the sense of the Conventions are morphisms of degree `a^n`; they agree with its iterates as a morphism. A morphism of degree `0` is constant, not dominant, and outside the composition of rational maps. Its iterates are taken in the composition of morphisms, equivalently with Mathlib's `Scheme.RationalMap.compHom`: `f^0 = id` and `f^n = f` for `n ≥ 1`. So `deg(f^n) = (deg f)^n` for every morphism `f` and every `n ≥ 0`, with `0^0 = 1`.

*Route.* Mathlib's `Scheme.RationalMap.equivFunctionFieldOver` identifies rational maps with `K(ℙ^d)`-points of `ℙ^d_K`. Over a field these are `(K(ℙ^d)^{d+1} ∖ 0)/K(ℙ^d)^×` by stacks-constructions Lemma 13.1. Clearing denominators and dividing by the greatest common divisor (`MvPolynomial` is a unique factorization domain) gives reduced forms. A codimension-one component of `V(F)` would give a common factor (silverman2014 lines 350–357; guedj2010 Exemple 2.2, lines 1145–1147; russakovskiishiffman1997 line 510). For equality in the composition: if `g` is a morphism, some power `x_j^N` lies in the ideal `(G_0, …, G_d)` for every `j`, so a common prime factor of the `G_i(F)` divides every `F_j^N`, hence every `F_j`, which is excluded. If `f` is a morphism of degree `a ≥ 1`, then `K[x_0, …, x_d]` is finite over `K[F_0, …, F_d]`, so `f` is finite; a common prime factor `p` of the `G_i(F)` would make `f` map the hypersurface `V(p)` into `V(G)`, of codimension `≥ 2`, which a finite map cannot do.

*Needs:* Mathlib `AlgebraicGeometry.Proj`, `MvPolynomial.homogeneousSubmodule`, `MvPolynomial.gradedAlgebra`, `MvPolynomial.uniqueFactorizationMonoid`, `Scheme.RationalMap.equivFunctionFieldOver`, `Scheme.RationalMap.comp`, `Scheme.RationalMap.IsDominant`, `Scheme.RationalMap.compHom`, `AlgebraicGeometry.IsFinite`; SchemeAndStackFoundations §0.3; StableReduction Layer 2.

**Checks.**

- For `d = 1` the reduced forms are the coprime binary forms of ArithmeticDynamics §0.18, and the scheme maps agree with §0.26 there.
- The Cremona forms `(x_1x_2, x_0x_2, x_0x_1)` have no common factor. Their composite with themselves is `(x_0x_1x_2)·(x_0, x_1, x_2)`, so `σ ∘ σ = id` after dividing by `h = x_0x_1x_2`.
- Non-example: the forms `(x_0², x_0x_1, x_0x_2)` have common factor `x_0` and define the identity, of degree `1`, not `2`.
- Non-example for composition: the constant morphism `f = [0 : 0 : 1]`, by the forms `(0, 0, 1)` of degree `0`, followed by the Cremona involution `σ = [x_1x_2 : x_0x_2 : x_0x_1]`. Substitution gives `G(F) = (0·1, 0·1, 0·0) = (0, 0, 0)`, because `[0 : 0 : 1]` is a base point of `σ`; there is no composite rational map, as the dominance hypothesis predicts. As a morphism `f` has iterates `f^n = f` for `n ≥ 1`, of degree `0`.
- For the dominant morphism `f = [x_0² : x_1² : x_2²]` and `g = σ`, `G(F) = (x_1²x_2², x_0²x_2², x_0²x_1²)` has no common factor, so `σ ∘ f` has degree `4 = 2·2`, the equality case for a morphism `f`. For `f = g = σ` the substitution has `h = x_0x_1x_2` and degree `1 < 4`.

### 6.2 Degrees on projective space

Let `f = [F_0 : ⋯ : F_d]` be dominant, with forms of degree `a ≥ 1` without common factor. Prove:

- `deg_{1,H}(f) = a`;
- `deg_{k+1,H}(f) ≤ a·deg_{k,H}(f)` for `0 ≤ k ≤ d − 1`, hence `deg_{k,H}(f) ≤ a^k` for `0 ≤ k ≤ d`;
- `deg_{k,H}(f) = a^k` for all `0 ≤ k ≤ d` when `f` is a morphism;
- for a morphism, `deg_{k,H}(f^n) = a^{nk}`, `λ_k(f) = a^k` and `e(f) = a^d`;
- `λ_1(f) = lim_n (deg f^n)^{1/n}`, Silverman's first dynamical degree;
- `deg_{1,H}(g ∘ f) ≤ deg_{1,H}(f)·deg_{1,H}(g)`, the constant being `1`.

*Route.* On `Γ_f ⊆ ℙ^d × ℙ^d` put `A = π_1^*H` and `B = π_2^*H`. The relations `F_i(x)y_j = F_j(x)y_i` hold on `Γ_f`. They glue the maps `y_j ↦ F_j(x)` into a nonzero section of `aA − B`, whose zero scheme is an effective Cartier divisor `E` supported in `π_1^{−1}(V(F))`. By the Cartier restriction formula and §3.2 on `E`, `(A^{d−k−1}B^k · (aA − B)) = (A^{d−k−1}B^k · E) ≥ 0`, which gives the recursion. For `k = 0`, every component of `E` maps into `V(F)`, of dimension `≤ d − 2`. The projection formula gives `(A^{d−1} · E) = 0`, so `deg_{1,H} = a·deg_{0,H} = a`. For a morphism `E` is empty and `B = aA`. The last items follow from §6.1 (russakovskiishiffman1997 Lemma 4.4, lines 516–541, with equality if and only if `codim I_P > ℓ`, and lines 506–514; Lemma 4.6, lines 582–583, over `ℂ`; guedj2010 Exemple 2.2, lines 1141–1147; silverman2014 lines 350–357 and (3), line 387).

**Checks.**

- For `d = 1`, `deg_{1,H}(f)` is the degree of ArithmeticDynamics §0.18, and `λ_1(f) = deg f = e(f)`.
- The Cremona involution of `ℙ²` has `deg_{2,H} = 1 < a² = 4`. Its base locus is three points, of dimension `d − 2 = 0`; Russakovskii–Shiffman's `δ_2 = a² − 3 = 1` agrees.
- The Frobenius of `ℙ^d` is a morphism of degree `p` with `deg_{k,H} = p^k`.
- Non-example: the non-reduced forms `(x_0², x_0x_1, x_0x_2)` define the identity, with `deg_{1,H} = 1 ≠ 2`. The no-common-factor hypothesis is needed.

### 6.3 Standard examples

- *The standard Cremona involution.* For `d ≥ 2` let `σ = [Π_{j≠0} x_j : ⋯ : Π_{j≠d} x_j]`, forms of degree `d` without common factor. Then `σ ∘ σ = id`, `deg_{1,H}(σ) = d`, `deg_{1,H}(σ²) = 1 < d²`, `e(σ) = 1`, `λ_k(σ) = 1` for all `k` and `h_alg(σ) = 0`. For `d = 2` the degrees are `(1, 2, 1)` (guedj2010 Exemple 2.5, lines 1272–1282, for `d = 3`; russakovskiishiffman1997 lines 542–552 for `d = 2`; truong2020 §6.4, lines 1542–1544).
- *The Fibonacci map.* `f[x : y : z] = [yz : xy : z²]` on `ℙ²`. For `n ≥ 1`, `f^n = [x^{fib(n−1)} y^{fib(n)} z^{fib(n)} : x^{fib(n)} y^{fib(n+1)} : z^{fib(n+2)}]`, by induction on `n` through the exponent matrix `[[0, 1], [1, 1]]`. These forms have no common factor, so `deg_{1,H}(f^n) = fib(n + 2)` for `n ≥ 1`. The iterate `f^0` is the identity, of degree `1 = fib 2`, so `deg_{1,H}(f^n) = fib(n + 2)` holds for every `n ≥ 0`; the coordinate formula is not used at `n = 0`. Further, `λ_1(f) = Real.goldenRatio`, `e(f) = 1` (on `z = 1` the inverse of `(x, y) ↦ (y, xy)` is `(u, v) ↦ (v/u, u)`), `λ_2(f) = 1` and `h_alg(f) = log Real.goldenRatio` (silverman2014 Example 5, lines 358–372).
- *Frobenius.* Over a field of characteristic `p`, `F = [x_0^p : ⋯ : x_d^p]` is a morphism of degree `p` with `λ_k(F) = p^k` and `λ_d(F) = e(F) = p^d`, a purely inseparable degree.

*Needs:* §§1.1, 4.2, 5.1–5.4, 6.1, 6.2; Mathlib `Nat.fib`, `Real.goldenRatio`.

**Checks.**

- Fibonacci map, `n = 0`: `f^0 = [x : y : z]`, of degree `1 = fib 2`. Substituting `n = 0` into the coordinate formula would give, with natural subtraction, `fib(0 − 1) = fib 0 = 0` and the tuple `(1, y, z)`, of coordinate degrees `0, 1, 1`. It is not homogeneous and does not define a map on `ℙ²` (the representatives `(2, 3, 1)` and `(4, 6, 2)` of one point go to `[1 : 3 : 1]` and `[1 : 6 : 2]`), which is why the formula is stated for `n ≥ 1`.
- Fibonacci map, `n = 2`: `[xyz : xy² : z³]`, degree `3 = fib 4`. For `n = 3`: `[xy²z² : x²y³ : z⁵]`, degree `5 = fib 5`. The exponent of `x` in the first coordinate at `n = 1` is `fib 0 = 0`.
- The Cremona involution of `ℙ³` has `deg_{1,H}(σ) = 3` and `deg_{1,H}(σ²) = 1`, as in Guedj's example.
- Frobenius with `p = 2`, `d = 1`: `deg_{1,H} = 2 = e`, a purely inseparable degree.

### 6.4 Polynomial self-maps of affine space

Let `F = (F_1, …, F_d)` with `F_i ∈ K[x_1, …, x_d]`, `F : 𝔸^d → 𝔸^d` dominant (the `F_i` algebraically independent over `K`), and `a = max_i deg F_i`. Prove:

- `a ≥ 1`, and the rational map `f = [x_0^a : x_0^a F_1(x/x_0) : ⋯ : x_0^a F_d(x/x_0)]` of `ℙ^d` has forms of degree `a` without common factor. Its domain contains `𝔸^d = {x_0 ≠ 0}`, and it restricts to `F` there.
- `deg_{1,H}(f) = a` and `λ_d(f) = e(f) = [K(x_1, …, x_d) : K(F_1, …, F_d)]`.
- For `G` another dominant polynomial self-map, the extension of `F ∘ G` is the composite of the extensions, the extension of `G` applied first, so `λ_1(f) = lim_n (max_i deg (F^{∘n})_i)^{1/n}`.
- If `F` is proper, it is finite (Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.IsFinite.iff_isProper_and_isAffineHom`, a morphism of affine schemes being affine) and surjective.

(dangfavre2021 lines 177–180 for the setting of Theorem 2; silverman2014 Example 6, lines 373–380.)

*Needs:* §§1.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2; Mathlib `AlgebraicGeometry.IsFinite.iff_isProper_and_isAffineHom`, `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAffineHom`.

**Checks.**

- `F = (x², y)` on `𝔸²`: `a = 2`, `e = 2`, and `F^{∘n}` has degree `2^n`, so `λ_1 = 2` and `λ_1² = 4 ≥ λ_2 = 2`. `F` is finite. Its extension has base point `[0 : 0 : 1]`, so it is not a morphism, yet `deg_{1,H}(f^n) = 2^n`.
- The Hénon map `F = (y, x + y²)` is an automorphism with `F^{∘n}` of degree `2^n`. So `λ_1 = 2`, `λ_2 = 1` and `λ_1² > λ_2`, the hypothesis of Dang–Favre's Theorem 2.
- Silverman's `F = (y, z, x + yz)` on `𝔸³` has iterates of degrees `2, 3, 5 = fib(n + 2)`, so `λ_1 = Real.goldenRatio` and, as an automorphism, `λ_3 = 1`.
- Non-example: `F = (x, xy)` is dominant and birational but not proper (the fibre over `(0, 1)` is empty), so the finiteness item does not apply.

### Examples

## Downstream consumers

- DynamicalDegreesOfRationalMaps, Part II: numerical cycle spaces `N^k(X)_ℝ` of codimension `k ≥ 2` over an arbitrary field, the operators `f^*` on all `N^k(X)_ℝ` and the spectral description of `λ_k` (dang2020 Theorem 2; truong2020 Theorem 1.1 (5)), relative dynamical degrees and the product formula (dang2020 Theorem 4; truong2020 Theorem 1.1 (4)). It starts from §§4.1–4.5 and §3.6.
- A roadmap on arithmetic degrees and canonical heights of dominant rational self-maps of `ℙ^N` (silverman2014 §§4–5), continuing ArithmeticDynamics. It needs `λ_1`, §6.2 and the sub-multiplicativity of §4.4.
- A roadmap on spectral interpretations of dynamical degrees (Dang–Favre b-classes and Theorems 1–2 of dangfavre2021). It needs `deg_{k,ω}`, §4.5 and `λ_1, λ_2` on normal projective varieties and on `ℙ^d`.
- Roadmaps on complex dynamics: the Dinh–Sibony entropy bound and Guedj's invariant measures need `h_alg` and log-concavity.

## Worked examples

| map | `d` | `deg_{k,H}(f)` | `λ_k(f)` | `e(f)` | `h_alg(f)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `z ↦ z²` on `ℙ¹` | 1 | `(1, 2)` | `(1, 2)` | 2 | `log 2` |
| Cremona `σ` on `ℙ²` | 2 | `(1, 2, 1)` | `(1, 1, 1)` | 1 | 0 |
| Fibonacci `[yz : xy : z²]` | 2 | `(1, 2, 1)`; `deg_{1,H}(f^n) = fib(n + 2)` | `(1, Real.goldenRatio, 1)` | 1 | `log Real.goldenRatio` |
| Frobenius on `ℙ^d`, char `p` | `d` | `(p^k)_k` | `(p^k)_k` | `p^d` | `d·log p` |
| extension of `(x², y)` | 2 | `(1, 2, 2)` | `(1, 2, 2)` | 2 | `log 2` |

The Fibonacci map has `deg_{2,H}(f) = e(f) = 1`. The extension of `(x², y)` has `deg_{2,H} = e = 2` and `deg_{1,H}(f^n) = 2^n`.
