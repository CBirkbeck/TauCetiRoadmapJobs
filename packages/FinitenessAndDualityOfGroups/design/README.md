# Roadmap: finiteness and duality of groups

**Summary.** This roadmap develops the homological finiteness and dimension theory of discrete
groups over an arbitrary commutative ring `R`, on Mathlib's carriers `groupCohomology`,
`groupHomology`, `tateCohomology` and `Rep R G`, and on Tau Ceti's module-level notions of
pseudocoherence, finite projective dimension and Gorenstein-projective objects. It defines the
finiteness types `FP_n`, `FP_∞`, `FP` and `FL` of a group over `R`, proves the Bieri–Eckmann–Brown
criterion by direct limits and products and the stability of the types under finite index,
extensions, products, amalgams and HNN extensions; defines cohomological and homological dimension
`cd_R` and `hd_R` with their behaviour under subgroups, extensions, directed unions and amalgams,
and the dichotomy for finite subgroups; constructs the signed tensor induction of complexes and
proves Serre's theorem that a torsion-free group has the cohomological dimension of each of its
finite-index subgroups; develops virtual cohomological dimension, the virtual types and groups of
finite homological type; defines geometric dimension and proves the Eilenberg–Ganea theorem;
develops duality and Poincaré duality groups over `R` with their dualizing module, orientation
character, criterion and inheritance; defines the Hattori–Stallings rank of projective modules over
group rings and proves Swan's theorem in its rational and mod-`p` forms; defines the Euler
characteristic of groups of finite homological type and proves its multiplicativity under finite
index and extensions, the equivariant formula for actions on acyclic complexes, and the
denominator theorem for groups of finite homological type, through Serre's action with finite
stabilizers on a finite-dimensional acyclic simplicial set and the classical Smith theory of finite
`p`-groups acting on such simplicial sets; and constructs
complete resolutions and Farrell cohomology for groups with a finite-index subgroup of finite
cohomological dimension, compared with ordinary cohomology above that dimension and with Tate
cohomology for finite groups. The end theorems are the finiteness criterion (1.5), Serre's theorem
(3.2), the Eilenberg–Ganea theorem (5.3), the duality criterion (6.3), the Euler characteristic of
groups of finite homological type with its multiplicativity (8.4, 8.6) and equivariant formula
(8.7), Brown's denominator theorem (8.9), and the comparison of Farrell cohomology with ordinary
cohomology above the virtual cohomological dimension (9.4).

## Scope and ownership

This roadmap owns the finiteness, dimension, duality and Euler-characteristic theory of discrete
groups and the Farrell cohomology of groups of finite virtual cohomological dimension. The group
`G` is an arbitrary group and the coefficients form an arbitrary commutative ring `R`; `R = ℤ` is an
instance, and a statement is made over `ℤ` only where the theory is integral: Serre's theorem, the
virtual cohomological dimension, the Euler characteristic, and Poincaré duality from abstract
isomorphisms. No other roadmap plans these objects:
CohomologyOfGroups excludes them by name in its Scope and names this roadmap among its downstream
consumers.

**Already in the library and used as it stands.** Mathlib's `groupCohomology`, `groupHomology` and
`tateCohomology` on `Rep R G`; the comparisons `groupCohomologyIsoExt`, `groupHomologyIsoTor` and
`groupCohomologyIso`; Shapiro's lemma `groupCohomology.coindIso` and `groupHomology.indIso`; the
equivalence `Rep.equivalenceModuleMonoidAlgebra` with modules over `MonoidAlgebra R G`;
`HasProjectiveDimensionLE`; `Group.IsFinitelyPresented`, `Monoid.PushoutI`, `HNNExtension`; the
cohomology of finite cyclic groups `Rep.FiniteCyclicGroup.groupCohomologyIsoEven`. Tau Ceti's
pseudocoherence `TauCeti.Huber.IsPseudoCoherentOver` with its degree-by-degree, two-out-of-three
and restriction-of-scalars lemmas; finite projective dimension `TauCeti.Module.IsFPD` with
`TauCeti.Module.isFPD_iff_hasProjectiveDimensionLE`; the least bound `TauCeti.leastENatBound`;
totally acyclic complexes of projectives and Gorenstein-projective objects in an abelian category
(`CochainComplex.IsTotallyAcyclicProjective`, `CategoryTheory.isGorensteinProjective`) with their
Frobenius exact structure and the comparison theorem for complete resolutions
(`TauCeti.ExactStructure.CompleteResolution.homotopyEquiv`); the cellular resolution of an
aspherical CW complex `TauCeti.cellularResolutionOfIsAspherical`; cell attachment, the Hurewicz and
Whitehead theorems; the vanishing of characters of projective modules at `p`-singular elements
`TauCeti.trace_ofModule'_eq_zero_of_dvd_orderOf`; Swan's theorem for `ℤ_p[G]`,
`TauCeti.nonempty_linearEquiv_of_projective_of_tensorRat`; and the determination of
finite-dimensional representations of a finite group by their characters in characteristic zero,
`FDRep.nonempty_iso_of_character_eq`. Exact statements are under Exact supplier contracts.

**Owned elsewhere and imported by section.**
- CohomologyOfGroups owns the operations on group (co)homology used throughout: permutation
  modules and Shapiro isomorphisms for `G`-sets (§1.4), the quotient action on the cohomology of a
  normal subgroup (§1.2), the comparison of continuous and discrete cohomology of a discrete group
  (§1.5), the orbit spectral sequence of a monomial complex (§3.2), the chain complex of a tree and
  the tree, amalgam, HNN and free-group sequences (§§3.4–3.6), the cap product (§4.6), the universal
  coefficient sequences (§5.2) and the Hochschild–Serre spectral sequences with convergence
  (§§6.2–6.3). This roadmap proves no spectral sequence and no product.
- SpectralSequencesAndConvergence owns the Euler identity of a spectral sequence converging in
  every total degree with finite filtrations and a page with finitely many nonzero terms in a weak
  Serre class (§3.4), and its form for the spectral sequence of a complex with a filtration finite
  in each degree (§5.3). 8.6 and 8.7 apply it, with the finite-dimensional `ℚ`-vector spaces and
  their dimension, to the Hochschild–Serre and orbit spectral sequences of CohomologyOfGroups.
- FreeGroupsAndLimitGroups owns graphs of groups, the identification of one-edge splittings with
  Mathlib's amalgams and HNN extensions (§4.5), the Bass–Serre tree (§4.7), the structure theorem
  for actions on trees (§4.8) and the fixed points of finite groups acting on trees (§4.9).
- SchemeKTheoryOperations §6.7 owns the identification of the homology of a directed union of
  subgroups with the colimit of their homology, over any commutative ring.
- EtaleCohomologyFoundations §F.10.3 owns the Hattori–Stallings trace of finite projective modules
  over an arbitrary ring with its additivity and scalar extension; Layer 7 specialises it to group
  rings.
- ClassifyingSpaces owns `K(G, 1)` CW complexes, their cellular chains as free resolutions (Stage 4
  item 16) and the identification of their (co)homology with local coefficients with group
  (co)homology (Stage 4 item 17). AlgebraicTopology owns cellular connectivity (§8.1), the absolute
  Hurewicz theorem in every universe (§8.3), Whitehead's theorem (§8.5), the finite CW type of
  compact Hausdorff smooth manifolds (§8.7) and twisted Poincaré duality of manifolds (§§6.3–6.4).
- ProfiniteCohomology Layer 11 owns the cohomological dimension of profinite groups, carried by Tau
  Ceti's `TauCeti.cohomologicalDimension` (continuous cohomology with discrete torsion
  coefficients). The invariant of this roadmap is the discrete one, under another name, compared
  with it in 2.8.
- Instances owned elsewhere and not restated: ArithmeticKTheory §3.2 owns the Borel–Serre duality of
  torsion-free finite-index subgroups of `Aut(P)` with the Steinberg dualizing module, an instance of
  Layer 6; FuchsianOrbifolds Layer 5 item 6 owns the orbifold Euler characteristic of a Fuchsian
  group by its signature, whose value `−1/6` at `PSL(2, ℤ)` is the value 8.7 gives the free product
  `ℤ/2 ∗ ℤ/3`; BianchiModularForms §9.3 owns the orbifold Euler characteristics of Bianchi groups;
  BordismFormalGroups owns a complete resolution of the profinite Morava stabilizer groups, a
  continuous theory distinct from Layer 9.
- GorensteinHomologicalAlgebra owns Gorenstein dimensions of modules over rings and excludes complete
  cohomology of groups. Layer 9 uses only the pinned Gorenstein-projective objects of an abelian
  category and owns Farrell cohomology.
- SheafTheoreticSmithTheory owns Smith restriction for prime-order actions on étale sheaves, a
  different theory. The classical Smith theory of 8.8 (finite `p`-groups acting on
  finite-dimensional simplicial sets with finite mod-`p` homology) and Serre's construction 5.4 of a
  finite-dimensional acyclic simplicial set with finite stabilizers have no other owner and are owned
  here.

**Non-goals.** Stallings' theorem on ends and the Stallings–Swan theorem that a group of
cohomological dimension one is free (so the classification of duality groups of dimension one is not
stated). Separations of the finiteness types (Bestvina–Brady groups, a group of type `FP_2` that is
not finitely presented) and the Eilenberg–Ganea problem in dimension two. The inequality
`cd_R G ≤ hd_R G + 1` for countable groups, which needs the Govorov–Lazard theorem over
noncommutative rings. Brown's refinements of the denominator theorem through the poset of nontrivial
finite subgroups, which need its equivariant Euler characteristic and the acyclic-cover comparison
of Brown1974 Appendix B: Theorem 5 for a nonempty family of finite subgroups, its Corollaries 2 and
3, Theorem 6 with the formula for `χ − χ_ℚ`, and the `p`-fractional part of `χ` (Brown1974 §§6–7).
Products on Farrell cohomology, which need a complete diagonal approximation. `L²`-invariants,
Bieri–Neumann–Strebel invariants, and the comparison of the Hattori–Stallings and rational Euler
characteristics beyond type `FL` (the Bass conjecture). The dimension theory of profinite groups.

## Conventions

- **Universes and rings.** `R G : Type u`, `[CommRing R]`, `[Group G]`; representations are objects
  of `Rep.{u} R G`, the generality of Mathlib's `groupCohomology` and `groupHomology`. For `R = ℤ`
  the group lies in `Type`, and so do the spaces of Layer 5 and the manifolds of 6.6. Subgroups
  `H ≤ G` carry restricted representations `Rep.res H.subtype M`, written `M`.
- **Group rings and modules.** `RG = MonoidAlgebra R G`. Representations and left `RG`-modules are
  identified by `Rep.equivalenceModuleMonoidAlgebra`; the trivial module `R` is
  `(Representation.trivial R G R).asModule`. A right module is turned into a left module by
  `g · m = m · g⁻¹` (BieriEckmann1973 line 122–124); tensor products `M ⊗_R N` and `Hom_R(M, N)` of
  representations carry the diagonal action `g(m ⊗ n) = gm ⊗ gn`, `(g · f)(m) = g f(g⁻¹ m)`,
  Mathlib's monoidal and internal-hom structures on `Rep`. The group ring `RG` as a coefficient
  representation carries the left regular action; `Hᵏ(G, RG)` then carries the action induced by
  right multiplication by `g⁻¹` on the coefficients, which commutes with the left action.
  Witness: for `G = ℤ = ⟨t⟩`, `H¹(G, RG) = RG/(t − 1)RG ≅ R` and right multiplication by `t⁻¹`
  acts trivially on it.
- **Finiteness index.** `n ∈ ℕ∞`; `FP_∞` is `FP_⊤`. The index of the types is that of
  pseudocoherence: `FP_0` means that the trivial module is finitely generated over `RG` (every group),
  `FP_1` that it is finitely presented. Witness: the additive group `ℚ` is of type `FP_0` and not of
  type `FP_1` over any nonzero `R`; the model shifted by one degree would make `FP_0` equivalent to
  finite generation of `ℚ`.
- **Dimensions.** `cd_R G` and `hd_R G` are valued in `ℕ∞` through `TauCeti.leastENatBound`, so a
  group with cohomology in infinitely many degrees has dimension `⊤`. Over the zero ring every
  representation is zero and every group has `cd_0 G = hd_0 G = 0`; statements about torsion,
  duality groups and Euler characteristics assume `R` nontrivial, and the zero ring is a
  negative-control Check where it matters.
- **Indices.** `[G : H]` is `H.index`, which is `0` for infinite index; every statement using it
  assumes `H.FiniteIndex`.
- **Cap product and duality map.** The cap product is CohomologyOfGroups §4.6's
  `∩ : Hᵏ(G, M) ⊗ Hₙ(G, N) → Hₙ₋ₖ(G, P)` for a pairing `μ : M ⊗ N ⟶ P`, adjoint to the cup product
  without sign. For `e ∈ Hₙ(G, D)` the *duality map* is `x ↦ x ∩ e` for the pairing
  `β : M ⊗ D ⟶ D ⊗ M` (the symmetry of `Rep`), a map `Hᵏ(G, M) → Hₙ₋ₖ(G, D ⊗_R M)` defined for
  `k ≤ n`; for `k > n` the duality statements are vanishing statements, since natural-number
  subtraction would read `n − k` as `0`. Witness: for `G = ℤ = ⟨t⟩`, `D = R` and `e` the class of
  the cycle `[t]`, the duality map `H¹(ℤ, R) = Hom(ℤ, R) → H₀(ℤ, R) = R` sends `x` to `x(t)`.
- **Hattori–Stallings rank.** For a finitely generated projective left `RG`-module `P`, `r_P` is the
  finitely supported function on conjugacy classes of `G` whose value at `[g]` is the coefficient of
  `[g]` in the Hattori–Stallings trace of `P` in `RG/[RG, RG] ≅ R^{(G/conj)}`. Witness: for `G`
  finite with `|G|` invertible in `R` and `P = R·e`, `e = |G|⁻¹ Σ_g g`, `r_P([g]) = |[g]|/|G| =
  1/|C_G(g)|`, so `r_P` is not `δ_{[1]}` although `P ≅ R` is cyclic.
- **Euler characteristics.** Two invariants are kept apart. For a group with `H_*(G, ℚ)`
  finite-dimensional, `χ_ℚ(G) = Σᵢ (−1)ⁱ dim_ℚ Hᵢ(G, ℚ) ∈ ℤ`; for a group of finite homological type
  (4.4), the Euler characteristic `χ(G) ∈ ℚ` is `χ_ℚ(H)/[G : H]` for a torsion-free finite-index `H`
  (8.4). They agree on torsion-free groups of finite homological type. Witness: for `G = ℤ/2`,
  `χ_ℚ(G) = 1` (rational homology is `ℚ` in degree `0`) while `χ(G) = χ_ℚ(1)/2 = 1/2`; for `G = ℤ`
  both are `1 − 1 = 0`. The cohomological sum `Σ(−1)ⁱ dim Hⁱ(G, ℚ)` equals `χ_ℚ(G)` by universal
  coefficients over a field.
- **Complete resolutions.** A complete resolution is a chain complex `(F_k)_{k ∈ ℤ}` with `d : F_k →
  F_{k−1}`; it is turned into a cochain complex by `Fᵏ := F_{−k}` when the pinned
  `CochainComplex.IsTotallyAcyclicProjective` is applied. Farrell cohomology is
  `Ĥᵏ(G, M) = Hᵏ(Hom_G(F, M))` with `Hom_G(F, M)` in degree `k` equal to `Hom_G(F_k, M)`. Witness:
  for `G = ℤ/2` and `M = ℤ`, `Ĥ⁰ = ℤ/2`, `Ĥ⁻¹ = 0`, `Ĥ¹ = 0`, `Ĥ² = ℤ/2`; the model shifted by one
  degree gives `Ĥ⁰ = 0`.
- **Spectral sequences.** Indexing and convergence are those of CohomologyOfGroups §§6.2–6.3.

  groupCohomology A n ≅ Extⁿ(k, A)` in `Rep k G` (GroupCohomology/Basic.lean line 202) and
  `groupHomologyIsoTor` (GroupHomology/Basic.lean line 246); `groupCohomologyIso`, computing
  cohomology from any projective resolution of the trivial representation. These identify `Hᵏ(G, −)`
  with `Ext^k_{RG}(R, −)` and `Hₖ(G, −)` with `Tor_k`, naturally in the coefficient.
- `groupCohomology.coindIso` (`.../GroupCohomology/Shapiro.lean` line 58) and `groupHomology.indIso`
  (`.../GroupHomology/Shapiro.lean` line 65), Shapiro's lemma for any subgroup.

  by the norm splice, with its long exact sequence; `TateCohomology.isoGroupCohomology`.

  line 157), `Representation.asModule` (`Mathlib/RepresentationTheory/Basic.lean` line 142),
  `Representation.trivial`, `Rep.res`.
- `HasProjectiveDimensionLE X n` (`Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Abelian/Projective/Dimension.lean` line 53):
  `Ext^i(X, Y) = 0` for all `Y` and `i ≥ n + 1`, in an abelian category; nothing about finite
  generation.
- `Rep.FiniteCyclicGroup.groupCohomologyIsoEven` (`.../GroupCohomology/FiniteCyclic.lean` line 80):
  for a finite cyclic group generated by `g` and `i > 0` even, `Hⁱ(G, A)` is the homology of
  `A →N A →(g − 1) A`; for trivial `A = R` this is `R/|G|R`.
- `Group.IsFinitelyPresented` (`Mathlib/GroupTheory/FinitelyPresentedGroup.lean` line 95), `PresentedGroup`,
  `FreeGroup`, `Monoid.PushoutI` (`Mathlib/GroupTheory/PushoutI.lean` line 60), `HNNExtension`
  (`Mathlib/GroupTheory/HNNExtension.lean` line 52), `Subgroup.index`, `Subgroup.FiniteIndex`.
- `Topology.CWComplex`, `Topology.RelCWComplex.FiniteDimensional` and `RelCWComplex.FiniteType`
  (`Mathlib/Topology/CWComplex/Classical/Finite.lean` lines 40 and 49): finite dimensionality means
  that `cell C n` is empty for all large `n`, finite type that each `cell C n` is finite.
- `Module.Flat` for modules over a commutative ring (used only for `R`-modules, never for
  `RG`-modules), `Module.Projective` and `Module.Finite` over any semiring, `PadicInt`.
- `IsMulTorsionFree` (`Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Monoid.lean` line 552), the meaning of *torsion-free*
  throughout: commuting elements with equal nonzero powers are equal; for a group it holds exactly
  when no element other than `1` has finite order (`isMulTorsionFree_iff_not_isOfFinOrder`,
  `Mathlib/GroupTheory/OrderOfElement.lean` line 911). Multiplicative `ℤ` satisfies it and `ℤ/2`
  does not (`s² = 1²` with `s ≠ 1`).
- `SSet`, its chain complex `SSet.chainComplex` and homology `SSet.homology`
  (`Mathlib/AlgebraicTopology/SimplicialSet/Homology/Basic.lean` lines 67 and 124): the unnormalized
  simplicial chains with coefficients in an object of a preadditive category, whose degree-`n` term
  is a coproduct over all `n`-simplices, degenerate ones included, so it does not vanish above the
  dimension (for `Δ[0]` it is `ℤ` in every degree). Homology is always `SSet.homology`; every
  chain-level argument of 5.4, 8.8 and 8.9 uses the normalized chains of
  `Mathlib/AlgebraicTopology/SimplicialSet/Homology/Nondegenerate.lean`:
  `SSet.normalizedChainComplex` (line 43, built from the canonical splitting `SSet.splitting` by
  nondegenerate simplices), whose degree-`n` term is the coproduct over the nondegenerate
  `n`-simplices (`SSet.isColimitCofanNormalizedChainComplex`, line 167);
  `SSet.homotopyEquivNormalizedChainComplex` (line 86), a homotopy equivalence from the unnormalized
  to the normalized chains, so both have the homology `SSet.homology`;
  `SSet.normalizedChainComplexMap` (line 200), the functoriality in simplicial maps;
  `SSet.isZero_normalizedChainComplex_X_of_hasDimensionLT` (line 182) and
  `SSet.isZero_homology_of_hasDimensionLT` (line 252): for `X.HasDimensionLT d` the normalized
  chains and the homology vanish in degrees `≥ d`. A simplicial set is finite-dimensional when
  `SSet.HasDimensionLE X N` holds for some `N` (`Mathlib/AlgebraicTopology/SimplicialSet/Dimension.lean`
  lines 32 and 36: every nondegenerate simplex has dimension at most `N`), and
  `SSet.hasDimensionLE_prod` (`Mathlib/AlgebraicTopology/SimplicialSet/FiniteProd.lean` line 66)
  bounds the dimension of a product by the sum of the dimensions.
- `IsCoveringMap.existsUnique_continuousMap_lifts` (`Mathlib/Topology/Homotopy/Lifting.lean`
  line 489): a map from a simply connected, locally path-connected space lifts uniquely along a
  covering map once the lift of one point is fixed.
- `ChartedSpace.secondCountable_of_sigmaCompact` (`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/ChartedSpace.lean`
  line 236): a σ-compact charted space over a second-countable model is second countable. Mathlib's
  `ChartedSpace` (line 141) and `IsManifold` (`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/IsManifold/Basic.lean`
  line 777) include no separation axiom, so 6.6 assumes `T2Space` explicitly.

  terminates: over `ℚ[ℤ/2]` the trivial module `ℚ` satisfies `IsFPD` with `m = 0` (it is
  projective, `2` being invertible) but has no finite resolution by finitely generated free modules, since
  every such resolution has even alternating sum of `ℚ`-dimensions while `dim_ℚ ℚ = 1`;

  projective modules), `LinearMap.projectiveTrace_eq_trace` (line 118, equal to Mathlib's
  `LinearMap.trace` on finite free modules) and `LinearMap.projectiveTrace_baseChange` (line 158).
  Mathlib's `LinearMap.trace` (`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Trace.lean` line 75) is defined to be `0` when
  the module has no finite basis, so it is not the trace of a finite projective module.
- `TauCeti.nonempty_linearEquiv_of_projective_of_tensorRat` (`TauCeti/NumberTheory/Padics/GroupAlgebra/Swan.lean`

- `FDRep.nonempty_iso_of_character_eq` and `Representation.nonempty_equiv_of_character_eq`

### From TauCetiRoadmap.CohomologyOfGroups

- §1.2: for `N ◁ G`, the representations of `G ⧸ N` on `Hᵏ(N, M)` and `Hₖ(N, M)`, natural in `M`.
- §1.4: for a `G`-set `X` with orbit representatives `Σ`, natural isomorphisms
  `Hₙ(G, k[X] ⊗ M) ≅ ⊕_{x ∈ Σ} Hₙ(G_x, M)` and `Hⁿ(G, Hom_k(k[X], M)) ≅ ∏_{x ∈ Σ} Hⁿ(G_x, M)`, and the

  degree.
- §3.2: for a monomial complex `C` (each `C_p ≅ ⊕_{σ ∈ Σ_p} Ind_{G_σ}^G(k_σ)` with `k_σ` a character),
  the orbit spectral sequence `E¹_{p,q} = ⊕_{σ ∈ Σ_p} H_q(G_σ, k_σ ⊗ M) ⇒ H^G_{p+q}(C; M)`, the first
  sequence of §2.3, and its cohomological dual; 3.1 there identifies `H^G_*(C; M)` with `H_*(G, M)`
  when `C` resolves `k` by `k`-flat terms.
- §3.4: for a `G`-tree (an action without inversions, with a `G`-invariant orientation `E⁺` of the
  edges), the exact sequence `0 → k[E⁺] → k[V] → k → 0` of permutation representations, split after
  forgetting the `G`-action (split over `k`) and not `G`-equivariantly: for `G = ℤ` translating the
  line it is `0 → k[t, t⁻¹] →(t − 1) k[t, t⁻¹] → k → 0`, where the `k`-linear section `1 ↦ [0]` is
  moved to `[1]` by `t`, and an equivariant section would be an invariant element of `k[ℤ]` of
  augmentation `1`, which does not exist for `k ≠ 0`. Layers 1 and 8 use only its exactness.
- §§3.5–3.6: the tree sequences, and for amalgams, HNN extensions and free groups the long exact
  sequences in homology and cohomology; for `F = FreeGroup S`, `Hⁿ(F, M) = Hₙ(F, M) = 0` for `n ≥ 2`
  and `0 → H₁(F, M) → M^{(S)} → M → H₀(F, M) → 0`.
- §4.6: the cap product `∩ : Hᵖ(G, M) ⊗ Hₙ(G, N) → Hₙ₋ₚ(G, P)` for `μ : M ⊗ N ⟶ P`, natural in the

  `E₂^{p,q} = Hᵖ(G ⧸ N, H^q(N, M)) ⇒ H^{p+q}(G, M)`, natural in `M` and in morphisms of extensions,
  with `H^{p+q}(G, M)` finitely filtered by subquotients of the `E₂^{p, n−p}`; it is realised as the
  spectral sequence of a filtration of the normalized cochains that is finite in each degree (§6.1),
  with the classical `E_r` on the native page `r + 1`.
- §6.3: the homological spectral sequence `E²_{p,q} = H_p(G ⧸ N, H_q(N, M)) ⇒ H_{p+q}(G, M)`.

### From TauCetiRoadmap.SpectralSequencesAndConvergence

- §3.4 (Euler identity): for a spectral sequence in Mathlib's carrier with a bidegree assignment
  (§2.1), converging weakly in every total degree to an abutment whose filtrations are finite, and a
  page `r` whose nonzero positions are finitely many and all lie in a weak Serre class `P`, only finitely
  many `Hⁿ` are nonzero and `Σ_n (−1)ⁿ v(Hⁿ) = Σ_{pq} (−1)^{deg pq} v(E_r(pq))` for every `v`
  additive on short exact sequences in `P`.
- §5.3 (Euler characteristic of a filtered complex): the same identity for Tau Ceti's spectral
  sequence of a cochain complex with a filtration finite in each degree, on a native page `r ≥ 2`
  (the classical `E_{r−1}`), with the sign `(−1)^{p+q}` of the total degree; the Hochschild–Serre
  sequence of CohomologyOfGroups §6.2 and the bicomplex sequences of its §2.3 are of this form.

These are used with `P` the finite-dimensional `ℚ`-vector spaces and `v` the dimension.

### From TauCetiRoadmap.FreeGroupsAndLimitGroups

- §4.5: one-edge graphs of groups are `Monoid.PushoutI` over `Bool` and `HNNExtension`.
- §4.7: the Bass–Serre tree of a graph of groups, a tree with an action without inversions whose
  vertex and edge stabilizers are conjugates of the vertex and edge groups.
- §4.8: a group acting freely without inversions on a tree is free.
- §4.9: an element of finite order acting on a tree without inversions is elliptic, and a finitely
  generated group of elliptic elements fixes a vertex; so a finite group fixes a vertex.

### From TauCetiRoadmap.SchemeKTheoryOperations

- §6.7: for a group `G` that is the union of a directed family of subgroups `G_i` and any
  representation `A` over a commutative ring, `Hₘ(G, A) = colim_i Hₘ(G_i, A)` through the maps
  induced by the inclusions.

### From TauCetiRoadmap.EtaleCohomologyFoundations

  values in `Λ/[Λ, Λ]`, with cyclicity, independence of the complement, additivity on direct sums and
  split exact sequences, and scalar extension along ring homomorphisms. Right modules are left
  modules over the opposite ring; 7.1 applies it to `(RG)ᵐᵒᵖ`, whose right modules are the left
  `RG`-modules, and `(RG)ᵐᵒᵖ/[,]` is `RG/[RG, RG]` as an additive group.

### From TauCetiRoadmap.ClassifyingSpaces

- §4.7: the realization of every simplicial set is a CW complex with one `n`-cell for each
  nondegenerate `n`-simplex, the characteristic map being the realized simplex composed with a fixed
  orientation homeomorphism carrying the ball class to the ordered simplex class; through the
  cellular boundary formula (§§4.2–4.3) the cellular chains of the realization are then the
  normalized simplicial chains, the identification 5.4 uses.
- §8.11a: every CW complex is homotopy equivalent to the realization of an abstract simplicial
  complex, by skeletal simplicial approximation and mapping cylinders (Hatcher's Theorem 2C.5, as
  cited there).

What AlgebraicTopology must provide (gap:simplicial-replacement-dimension): in §8.11a, the abstract
simplicial complex replacing a CW complex of dimension at most `N` can be chosen of dimension at most
`N`, as the skeletal construction gives.

## How to read the build

Layer 1 defines the finiteness types on Tau Ceti's pseudocoherence and finite projective dimension,
proves a module-level criterion by directed colimits, and deduces the group criterion and the
stability of the types under finite index, extensions, products and splittings over trees. Layer 2
defines `cd_R` and `hd_R`, identifies them with projective dimension and Tor-vanishing, proves their
behaviour under subgroups, extensions, directed unions and amalgams, the dichotomy for finite
groups, and compares `cd_ℤ` with the profinite invariant. Layer 3 constructs the signed tensor
induction of complexes and proves Serre's theorem, which Layer 4 needs to make the virtual
cohomological dimension independent of the subgroup; Layer 4 also defines the virtual types and the
groups of finite homological type on which Layer 8 rests. Layer 5 compares `cd` with the geometric
dimension, proves the Eilenberg–Ganea theorem and builds Serre's action of a group of finite `vcd`
with finite stabilizers on a finite-dimensional acyclic simplicial set; later layers use its
comparison 5.2, in the manifold theorem 6.6, and Serre's construction 5.4, in the denominator theorem
8.9. Layer 6 develops duality groups from the cap product of CohomologyOfGroups and the finiteness criterion of
Layer 1. Layer 7 is independent of Layers 2–6: it specialises the Hattori–Stallings trace to group
rings and proves Swan's theorem and Brown's theorem on `Hom` from a projective module into a
finite-dimensional representation, which Layer 8 uses to define and multiply Euler
characteristics; Layer 8 also proves the classical Smith theory of finite `p`-groups acting on
finite-dimensional simplicial sets, which with 5.4 bounds the denominator of the Euler
characteristic. Layer 9 builds complete resolutions and Farrell cohomology from the pinned
Gorenstein-projective objects, using Layers 2 and 4.

## Layer 1: finiteness types of groups

### 1.1 Finiteness of modules by directed colimits

Prove, for a ring `A` (not necessarily commutative), a left `A`-module `M` in the universe of `A`,
and directed systems `(N_i)_{i ∈ I}` of `A`-modules indexed by a directed preorder `I` in the same
universe, with `c_k : colim_i Ext^k_A(M, N_i) → Ext^k_A(M, colim_i N_i)` the canonical map:

- (a) `M` is finitely generated if and only if `c_0` is injective for every directed system, if and
  only if `colim_i Hom_A(M, N_i) = 0` for every directed system with `colim_i N_i = 0`;
- (b) `M` is finitely presented if and only if `c_0` is bijective for every directed system;
- (c) for `n ∈ ℕ`, `M` is `n`-pseudocoherent if and only if `c_k` is bijective for `k < n` and
  injective for `k = n`, for every directed system, if and only if `colim_i Ext^k_A(M, N_i) = 0` for
  all `k ≤ n` and every directed system with zero colimit.

(Brown1975 Theorem 2, (i)–(iii), lines 83–92, stated there for complexes of projectives over any
ring and applied to a projective resolution of `M`; Corollary of Theorem 1, lines 78–81; Lemma 1(a),
lines 105–114, for (a).) Route: (a) and (b) by the direct system of quotients `M/M'` over finitely
generated submodules `M'` (Brown1975 line 111–114) and, for (b), the five lemma on a presentation;
(c) by induction on `n`: write `0 → K → Aᵐ → M → 0` with `M` finitely generated; directed colimits
of modules are exact, `Ext^k(Aᵐ, −) = 0` for `k ≥ 1` and `Hom(Aᵐ, −)` commutes with colimits, so the
long exact `Ext`-sequence shows that the conditions on `M` in degrees `≤ n + 1` are the conditions on
`K` in degrees `≤ n` together with (a) for `M`; then `TauCeti.Huber.IsPseudoCoherentOver.succ_iff_ker`.
*Needs:* Tau Ceti `TauCeti.Huber.IsPseudoCoherentOver`, `.zero_iff`, `.one_iff`, `.succ_iff_ker`;
Mathlib `Ext` in `ModuleCat A` and its long exact sequence, colimits in `ModuleCat A`.

- For `n`-pseudocoherent `M`, the functors `Ext^k_A(M, −)` for `k < n` preserve directed colimits.
- The conditions in (c) are monotone in `n`, and for `n = ⊤` they read: `Ext^k_A(M, −)` preserves
  directed colimits for every `k`.

**Checks.**

- For `A = ℤ` and `M = ℚ`, the system `N_i = ℚ/(1/i!)ℤ` has zero colimit while the projections
  `ℚ → N_i` define a nonzero element of `colim_i Hom(ℚ, N_i)`, since none of them is zero: `ℚ` is not
  finitely generated, as (a) requires.
- Finitely generated is weaker than finitely presented: for `A = k[x₁, x₂, …]` over a field and
  `M = A/(x₁, x₂, …) = k`, the system `N_i = A/(x₁, …, x_i)` has colimit `k`, every `Hom_A(k, N_i)` is
  zero because `x_{i+1}` is a non-zero-divisor on `N_i`, and `Hom_A(k, k) = k`: `c_0` is injective
  and not surjective.
- For `M = 0` every condition holds in every degree, and `0` is `⊤`-pseudocoherent.

### 1.2 The finiteness types

Define, for `n ∈ ℕ∞`, `G` to be *of type `FP_n` over `R`* when the trivial module `R` is
`n`-pseudocoherent over `RG` (`TauCeti.Huber.IsPseudoCoherentOver`), *of type `FP_∞`* when it is of
type `FP_⊤`, *of type `FP`* when `R` has a finite resolution by finitely generated projective
`RG`-modules (`TauCeti.Module.IsFPD RG R m` for some `m : ℕ`), and *of type `FL`* when `R` has a
resolution `0 → F_m → ⋯ → F_0 → R → 0` by finitely generated free `RG`-modules (BieriEckmann1973
§4.1, lines 540–544, types (FP) and (FF) over `ℤ`; BieriEckmann1974, §3.3, lines 286–287, finitely
generated free resolutions; Brown1974, §3, lines 345–351; Serre1971Bourbaki 1.2, lines 55–58).
*Needs:* Mathlib `MonoidAlgebra`, `Representation.trivial`, `Representation.asModule`; Tau Ceti
`TauCeti.Huber.IsPseudoCoherentOver`, `TauCeti.Module.IsFPD`.

- The types are invariant under isomorphisms of groups.
- `G` is of type `FP_n` over `R` exactly when `R` has a projective resolution `P → R` with
  `P_0, …, P_n` finitely generated, by `TauCeti.Huber.IsPseudoCoherentOver.ker_of_projective`.
- `FP_n` is antitone in `n`, and `G` is of type `FP_∞` exactly when it is of type `FP_n` for every
  `n : ℕ` (`.mono`, `.top_iff`).
- `G` is of type `FP` over `R` exactly when it is of type `FP_∞` and `R` has finite projective
  dimension over `RG` (`TauCeti.Module.isFPD_iff_hasProjectiveDimensionLE`); with 2.1 this reads:
  type `FP` is type `FP_∞` with `cd_R G < ⊤` (BieriEckmann1974 Proposition 3.2, lines 288–295).
- A group of type `FP` over `R` is of type `FL` exactly when, in a finite resolution whose terms
  below the top are finitely generated free, the top term is stably free (BrownGTM87, §VIII.6, by the
  Eilenberg swindle on the top two terms).

**Checks.**

- The trivial group is of type `FL` over every `R`, with the resolution `0 → R → R → 0`.
- `ℤ = ⟨t⟩` is of type `FL` over every `R`, with `0 → R[ℤ] →(t − 1) R[ℤ] → R → 0`
  (CohomologyOfGroups §3.4, Check for the line).
- Over the zero ring every group is of type `FL`; over `R ≠ 0` the additive group `ℚ` is of type
  `FP_0` and not of type `FP_1` (1.4), so the index of the types is that of pseudocoherence.
- A nontrivial finite group `G` is of type `FP_∞` over `ℤ` (`ℤG` is noetherian,
  `TauCeti.Huber.IsPseudoCoherentOver.of_isNoetherianRing`) and not of type `FP` over `ℤ` (2.7); over a
  field in which `|G|` is invertible it is of type `FP`, since `R` is then a direct summand of `RG`.

### 1.3 Implications and change of coefficients

Prove `FL ⇒ FP ⇒ FP_∞ ⇒ FP_n ⇒ FP_m` for `m ≤ n`, and that for a homomorphism of commutative rings
`R → R'` a group of type `FP_n` (`FP`, `FL`) over `R` is of that type over `R'`. Route: a partial
resolution `F_n → ⋯ → F_0 → R → 0` by free `RG`-modules, exact at `R, F_0, …, F_{n−1}`, consists of
free `R`-modules and ends in the free `R`-module `R`, so it is split exact over `R` in those degrees;
`R' ⊗_R −` keeps it exact and turns `RG^k` into `R'G^k` (BrownGTM87, §VIII.5).
*Needs:* 1.2; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.Module.IsFPD.isPseudoCoherentOver`, `TauCeti.Huber.IsPseudoCoherentOver.mono`.

**Checks.**

- The converse of the change of coefficients fails: `ℤ/2` is of type `FP` over `ℚ` and not over `ℤ`.
- Base change to the zero ring makes every group of type `FL`, consistent with 1.2.
- For `R = ℤ → R' = 𝔽_p`, the resolution `0 → ℤ[ℤ] → ℤ[ℤ] → ℤ → 0` becomes
  `0 → 𝔽_p[ℤ] → 𝔽_p[ℤ] → 𝔽_p → 0`, still exact.

### 1.4 Low degrees

Prove: (a) every group is of type `FP_0` over `R`; (b) for `R` nontrivial, `G` is of type `FP_1` over
`R` if and only if `G` is finitely generated; (c) a finitely presented group
(`Group.IsFinitelyPresented`) is of type `FP_2` over every `R`. (Brown1974, §4, lines 441–447, for
(b): if the augmentation ideal is generated by `s_i − 1` for finitely many `s_i`, the subgroup they
generate fixes the identity coset in `R[G/⟨s_i⟩]` and so is `G`; BieriEckmann1974 line 294;
BieriEckmann1973 line 662, sequence (5.1), for (c).) Route for (b): `R` is finitely presented over
`RG` exactly when the augmentation ideal is finitely generated (`TauCeti.Huber.IsPseudoCoherentOver.one_iff`,
`.succ_iff_ker`), and the augmentation ideal is generated by the `g − 1` for `g` in any generating
set. Route for (c): for a presentation `⟨S | Rel⟩` with `S` and `Rel` finite, the resolution
`TauCeti.cellularClassifyingSpaceResolution` is free on the cells of the cellular classifying space
(`TauCeti.cellularChainRepIsoFree`), whose cells of dimension at most `2` are the single vertex,
the `1`-cells `S` and the `2`-cells `Rel` of the presentation complex
(`TauCeti.PresentationComplex.cellOneEquiv`, `.cellTwoEquiv`), the cells attached afterwards having
dimension at least `3`; so its terms of degree `≤ 2` are finitely generated.
*Needs:* 1.2; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.Huber.IsPseudoCoherentOver.zero_iff`, `.one_iff`, `.succ_iff_ker`,
`TauCeti.cellularClassifyingSpaceResolution`, `TauCeti.cellularChainRepIsoFree`,
`TauCeti.PresentationComplex.cellOneEquiv`, `TauCeti.PresentationComplex.cellTwoEquiv`; Mathlib
`Group.IsFinitelyPresented`, `PresentedGroup`.

**Checks.**

- `ℚ` and the free group on an infinite set are not finitely generated, hence not of type `FP_1` over
  any nonzero `R`; over the zero ring they are (1.2), so the nontriviality hypothesis of (b) is used.
- A finite group is finitely presented, so of type `FP_2` over every `R`; the free group `G` on two
  generators `s, t` is finitely presented with no relator, and its resolution of (c) has terms `RG`,
  `(RG)²`, `0` in degrees `0, 1, 2` over the augmentation `RG → R` in degree `−1`, the boundary being
  `(a, b) ↦ a(s − 1) + b(t − 1)`: over `ℤ` the degree-`0` term `ℤG` (one free orbit of vertices of
  the universal cover) has infinite rank as an abelian group, while a model putting `R` in degree `0`
  would give rank `1`.
- The normal closure of `b` in `FreeGroup {a, b}` is free on the conjugates `aᵏba⁻ᵏ`, `k ∈ ℤ`, so its
  abelianization is free of infinite rank and it is not of type `FP_1`: `FP_1` does not pass to
  subgroups of infinite index.

### 1.5 The finiteness criterion

Prove, for `n ∈ ℕ`, that the following are equivalent (Brown1975 Theorem 2, lines 83–101, applied
to a projective resolution of the trivial module over `RG`; Theorem 3, lines 189–194, for `FP_∞`;
BieriEckmann1974 Proposition 1.2, lines 135–137, for (e)):

- (a) `G` is of type `FP_n` over `R`;
- (b) for every directed system `(M_i)` of representations, `colim_i Hᵏ(G, M_i) → Hᵏ(G, colim_i M_i)`
  is bijective for `k < n` and injective for `k = n`;
- (c) for every directed system with `colim_i M_i = 0`, `colim_i Hᵏ(G, M_i) = 0` for `k ≤ n`;
- (d) for every family `(N_j)_{j ∈ J}` of representations, `Hₖ(G, ∏_j N_j) → ∏_j Hₖ(G, N_j)` is
  bijective for `k < n` and surjective for `k = n`;
- (e) the same as (d) for every family of copies of `RG`.

`G` is of type `FP_∞` exactly when (b), equivalently (d), holds in every degree. The exact degree
bounds are part of the statement. Route: (a) ⇔ (b) ⇔ (c) is 1.1(c) for `A = RG` and `M = R`,
through `groupCohomologyIsoExt` and `Rep.equivalenceModuleMonoidAlgebra`, under which directed
colimits of representations are those of the underlying modules. (a) ⇒ (d): with `P_0, …, P_n`
finitely generated projective, `− ⊗_{RG} P_k` commutes with products for `k ≤ n`, and the five lemma
on the truncation gives the bounds (Brown1975 lines 147–157). (d) ⇒ (e) is immediate. (e) ⇒ (a):
induction along `0 → K → RGᵐ → R → 0` as in BieriEckmann1974 Lemma 1.1 and Proposition 1.2 (lines
95–137), with `Hₖ(G, N) = Tor_k^{RG}(R, N)` and `Tor^{RG}_k(K, N) ≅ Hₖ(G, K ⊗_R N)`, `K` being
projective over `R`. *Needs:* 1.1, 1.2; Mathlib `groupCohomologyIsoExt`, `groupHomologyIsoTor`,
`Rep.equivalenceModuleMonoidAlgebra`.

**Checks.**

- For `n = 0`, (b) asks injectivity of `colim (M_i)^G → (colim M_i)^G`, which holds for every group,
  as 1.4(a) requires.
- For `G = ℚ`, `R ≠ 0`, `n = 1`: the system `M_i = R[ℚ/(1/i!)ℤ]` has colimit `R`, each `(M_i)^ℚ` is
  zero (infinite orbits), and `(colim M_i)^ℚ = R`, so (b) fails at `k = 0 < 1`.
- For `G = ℚ`, (e) fails at `k = 0`: the element `(1 − 1/j!)_j` of `∏_j Rℚ` maps to zero in `∏_j R`
  but is not in the augmentation ideal times `∏_j Rℚ`, since that would place every `1/j!` in a single
  finitely generated, hence cyclic, subgroup of `ℚ`.

### 1.6 Subgroups of finite index

Prove that for `H ≤ G` of finite index, `G` is of type `FP_n` over `R` if and only if `H` is, and that
types `FP` and `FL` pass from `G` to `H` (BrownGTM87, §VIII.5). Route: `RG` is a free left
`RH`-module of rank `[G : H]` on a set of representatives of `H\G`, hence `n`-pseudocoherent over
`RH` for every `n`, and `TauCeti.Huber.isPseudoCoherentOver_restrictScalars_iff` applies to
`RH → RG`; restriction of a finite projective (free) resolution is one. *Needs:* 1.2; Tau Ceti
`TauCeti.Huber.isPseudoCoherentOver_restrictScalars_iff`; Mathlib `Subgroup.FiniteIndex`.

**Checks.**

- For `G = ℤ/2 × ℤ ⊇ H = 0 × ℤ` over `ℤ`: `H` is of type `FL`, so `G` is of type `FP_∞`, while `G`
  is not of type `FP` (it contains `ℤ/2`, 2.7): type `FP` does not pass up to a finite-index
  supergroup in general; over `ℚ`, `G` is of type `FP`.
- For `H = G` the statement is the identity; for `H` of infinite index the normal closure of `b` in
  the free group on `a, b` (1.4) shows that nothing passes down.

### 1.7 Extensions and products

Prove: (a) if `N ◁ G` and `N` and `G ⧸ N` are of type `FP_n` over `R`, then so is `G`
(BieriEckmann1974 Proposition 3.3(a), lines 298–313, states it for `FP_∞` and `FP` over `ℤ`, by the
spectral sequence of the extension; for finite `n` and arbitrary `R` the route below, through the
criterion 1.5(c), is the proof); (b) if `A` and `B`
are of type `FL` (`FP`, `FP_n`) over `R`, so is `A × B` (BrownGTM87, §VIII.5). Route for (a):
criterion 1.5(c). For a directed system `(M_i)` with zero colimit, the spectral sequences of
CohomologyOfGroups §6.2 for the `M_i` form a directed system whose colimit is a convergent spectral
sequence (directed colimits are exact) with `E₂`-terms `colim_i Hᵖ(G ⧸ N, H^q(N, M_i))`. For `q ≤ n`
the system `(H^q(N, M_i))_i` of `G ⧸ N`-representations (CohomologyOfGroups §1.2) has zero colimit by
1.5(c) for `N`, so 1.5(c) for `G ⧸ N` kills these terms for `p ≤ n`; hence every graded piece of
`colim_i Hᵏ(G, M_i)` vanishes for `k ≤ n`. Route for (b): for resolutions `P → R` over `RA` and
`Q → R` over `RB` whose terms are projective over `R` (projective over the group ring, `RA` and `RB`
being free over `R`), the tensor product `P ⊗_R Q` is a resolution of `R` over
`RA ⊗_R RB = R[A × B]` (Künneth over `R` for complexes of projective, hence flat, `R`-modules), with
`P_i ⊗_R Q_j` a finitely generated projective (free) `R[A × B]`-module when `P_i` and `Q_j` are
finitely generated projective (free). For type `FL` take finite resolutions by finitely generated
free modules; for type `FP` finite resolutions by finitely generated projective modules, which
`TauCeti.Module.IsFPD` provides but which need not be free (the trivial `ℚ[ℤ/2]`-module `ℚ` of the
Tau Ceti supplier contract); for type `FP_n` free resolutions whose terms in degrees `≤ n` are finitely generated, so that the total
degree `k ≤ n` term `⊕_{i+j=k} P_i ⊗_R Q_j` is finitely generated. *Needs:* 1.2, 1.5;
CohomologyOfGroups §1.2, §6.2; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.Module.IsFPD`.

**Checks.**

- `ℤⁿ` is of type `FL` over every `R`, as the `n`-fold product of `ℤ` (1.2).
- `ℤ/2 × ℤ` is of type `FP_∞` over `ℤ` as an extension of `ℤ` by `ℤ/2`, in agreement with 1.6.
- The extension statement has no converse: the lamplighter group `ℤ/2 ≀ ℤ` is generated by two
  elements, so of type `FP_1`, while its normal subgroup `⊕_ℤ ℤ/2` is not finitely generated.

### 1.8 Amalgams, HNN extensions and free groups

Prove: (a) for injective `C →* A` and `C →* B`, if `A` and `B` are of type `FP_n` over `R` and `C` is
of type `FP_{n−1}`, then the amalgam `A ∗_C B` (`Monoid.PushoutI` over `Bool`) is of type `FP_n`;
(b) for `A, B ≤ H` with `φ : A ≃* B`, if `H` is of type `FP_n` and `A` of type `FP_{n−1}`, then
`HNNExtension H A B φ` is of type `FP_n`; (c) the free group on a finite set `S` is of type `FL` over
every `R`, with the resolution `0 → RF^{(S)} → RF → R → 0` (BieriEckmann1973 Proposition 5.1, lines 646–650,
type (FF) over `ℤ` for nontrivial free groups; CohomologyOfGroups §3.6; for (a) and (b) the route
below, through the Bass–Serre tree and the cokernel lemma for pseudocoherence, is the proof).
Here `n − 1` is subtraction in `ℕ∞`, so `0 − 1 = 0` and `⊤ − 1 = ⊤`. Route: the Bass–Serre tree of
the one-edge graph of groups (FreeGroupsAndLimitGroups §§4.5, 4.7) gives by CohomologyOfGroups §3.4
the exact sequences `0 → R[G/C] → R[G/A] ⊕ R[G/B] → R → 0` and `0 → R[G/A] → R[G/H] → R → 0` of
`RG`-modules; `R[G/A] = RG ⊗_{RA} R`, and induction along `RA → RG`, `RG` being free over `RA`, is
exact and sends `RAᵏ` to `RGᵏ`, so it preserves `m`-pseudocoherence; conclude with
`TauCeti.Huber.IsPseudoCoherentOver.cokernel` and `.prod`. *Needs:* 1.2; CohomologyOfGroups §3.4,
§3.6; FreeGroupsAndLimitGroups §4.5, §4.7; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.Huber.IsPseudoCoherentOver.cokernel`,
`.prod`; Mathlib `Monoid.PushoutI`, `HNNExtension`.

**Checks.**

- `ℤ/4 ∗_{ℤ/2} ℤ/6` is of type `FP_∞` over `ℤ`, its factors and edge group being finite.
- `BS(1, 2) = HNNExtension ℤ ℤ (2ℤ) (×2)` is of type `FP_∞` over every `R`.
- For `n = 1` the condition on `C` is vacuous: an amalgam of finitely generated groups over any
  subgroup is finitely generated.

### Examples

`ℤⁿ`, free groups of finite rank and `BS(1, 2)` are of type `FL` (the last as an HNN extension of
`ℤ` over `ℤ`, with resolution of length `2`); nontrivial finite groups and `ℤ/2 × ℤ` are of type `FP_∞` but
not `FP` over `ℤ`, and of type `FP` over `ℚ`, while the trivial group is of type `FL` over every
`R`; `ℚ` and infinitely generated free groups are not of type `FP_1` over any nonzero `R`.

## Layer 2: cohomological and homological dimension

### 2.1 Definitions and characterizations

Define the *cohomological dimension* `cd_R G` as the least `n ∈ ℕ∞` such that `Hᵏ(G, M) = 0` for every
`M : Rep R G` and every `k > n`, through `TauCeti.leastENatBound` (Serre1971Bourbaki 1.1, lines
40–42; Brown1974, §3, lines 345–348), and the *homological dimension* `hd_R G` in the same way with
`Hₖ(G, M)` (BieriEckmann1973 line 155). The name differs from the profinite
`TauCeti.cohomologicalDimension`. Prove that for `n ∈ ℕ` the following are equivalent:
`cd_R G ≤ n`; `HasProjectiveDimensionLE (Rep.trivial R G R) n` in `Rep R G`; the `n`-th syzygy of some
(every) projective resolution of `R` over `RG` is projective; `R` has a projective resolution of
length at most `n`. Prove that `hd_R G ≤ n` if and only if `Tor_k^{RG}(N, R) = 0` for every right
`RG`-module `N` and every `k > n`. *Needs:* Mathlib `groupCohomology`, `groupHomology`,
`groupCohomologyIsoExt`, `groupHomologyIsoTor`, `HasProjectiveDimensionLE`; Tau Ceti
`TauCeti.leastENatBound`, `TauCeti.leastENatBound_le_iff`.

- The vanishing predicates are monotone in `n`, so `cd_R G ≤ n` holds exactly when the predicate
  holds at `n` (`TauCeti.leastENatBound_le_iff`); `cd_R G = ⊤` exactly when for every `n` some
  `Hᵏ(G, M)` with `k > n` is nonzero.
- `cd_R G = 0` exactly when `R` is a projective `RG`-module.
- If `Hᵏ(G, M) ≠ 0` then `k ≤ cd_R G`; likewise for `hd_R`.
- Both invariants are invariant under isomorphisms of groups.

**Checks.**

- `cd_R 1 = hd_R 1 = 0`.
- For `R ≠ 0`, `cd_R ℤ = hd_R ℤ = 1`: the resolution of 1.2 has length `1`, and
  `H¹(ℤ, R) = Hom(ℤ, R) = R ≠ 0`, `H₁(ℤ, R) = R ≠ 0`.
- Over the zero ring, `cd_0 G = hd_0 G = 0` for every `G`, including `G = ℤ/2`, while
  `cd_ℤ (ℤ/2) = ⊤` (2.7).

### 2.2 Homological against cohomological dimension, and type `FP`

Prove: (a) `hd_R G ≤ cd_R G`; (b) if `cd_R G < ⊤` and `Hᵏ(G, F) = 0` for every free `RG`-module `F`
and every `k > n`, then `cd_R G ≤ n` (BieriEckmann1973 Proposition 2.1, lines 280–286, by dimension
shifting along a free presentation); (c) for `G` of type `FP` over `R` with
`cd_R G = n`, putting `C = Hⁿ(G, RG)` (Conventions), there is `e ∈ Hₙ(G, C)` such that
`x ↦ x ∩ e` is an isomorphism `Hⁿ(G, A) ≅ H₀(G, C ⊗_R A) = C ⊗_{RG} A`, natural in `A`
(BieriEckmann1973 Theorem 4.2, lines 566–602, over `ℤ`; the argument uses only that `P_n` is
finitely generated projective, through `Hom_{RG}(P_n, A) ≅ P_n^* ⊗_{RG} A`); (d) for `G` of type
`FP` over `R`, `cd_R G = hd_R G` (BieriEckmann1973 Corollary 4.3, lines 604–607), and if moreover
`R` is nontrivial, `cd_R G` is the largest `k` with `Hᵏ(G, RG) ≠ 0` (cohomology of a group of type
`FP` commutes with direct sums, then (b); BieriEckmann1973 lines 615–621). *Needs:* 2.1, 1.2; CohomologyOfGroups
§4.6; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.Module.isFPD_iff_hasProjectiveDimensionLE`.

**Checks.**

- For `G = ℤⁿ` and `R ≠ 0`, `cd_R = hd_R = n` and `Hⁿ(ℤⁿ, Rℤⁿ) ≅ R`, the top cohomology of the
  Koszul resolution dualised; `Hᵏ(ℤⁿ, Rℤⁿ) = 0` for `k ≠ n`.
- (d) needs type `FP`: for the additive group `ℚ`, `hd_ℤ ℚ = 1` and `cd_ℤ ℚ = 2` (2.5).
- For the finite group `ℤ/2` over `ℤ`, `hd = cd = ⊤`, and `(ℤ[ℤ/2])^{ℤ/2} ≠ 0` while
  `Hᵏ(ℤ/2, ℤ[ℤ/2]) = 0` for `k > 0`: (d) is not claimed outside type `FP`.
- Over the zero ring and `G = 1`, `cd_0 1 = 0` and every `Hᵏ(1, F)` is zero, so no degree carries
  nonzero cohomology with free coefficients: (b) gives `cd_0 1 ≤ n` for every `n ∈ ℕ`, which is
  true, while a model of `cd_R G` as the largest `k` with some `Hᵏ(G, F) ≠ 0` would have no value.
  This is why (b) is an upper bound and the characterization in (d) assumes `R` nontrivial; over
  `R ≠ 0` and `G = ℤ²`, `H²(ℤ², Rℤ²) = R ≠ 0` and `cd_R ℤ² = 2`.

### 2.3 Subgroups

Prove: (a) for `H ≤ G`, `cd_R H ≤ cd_R G` and `hd_R H ≤ hd_R G`, by Shapiro's lemma
(`Hᵏ(H, M) ≅ Hᵏ(G, Coind M)`, `Hₖ(H, M) ≅ Hₖ(G, Ind M)`); (b) if `H` has finite index and
`cd_R G < ⊤`, then `cd_R H = cd_R G` (BieriEckmann1973 Proposition 2.1, lines 280–286, with
`RG ≅ Coind_H^G RH` and coinduction commuting with direct sums at finite index; BieriEckmann1973
line 396); (c) if `H` has finite index and `[G : H]` is a unit of `R`, then `cd_R G ≤ cd_R H` and
`hd_R G ≤ hd_R H`, since restriction followed by corestriction is multiplication by `[G : H]`
(BrownGTM87, §III.10). *Needs:* 2.1, 2.2; Mathlib `groupCohomology.coindIso`, `groupHomology.indIso`;
Tau Ceti `TauCeti.groupCohomology.corestriction`,
`TauCeti.groupCohomology.map_subtype_id_comp_corestriction`, `TauCeti.groupHomology.transfer`.

**Checks.**

- (b) needs `cd_R G < ⊤`: for `G = ℤ/2 × ℤ ⊇ H = 0 × ℤ` over `ℤ`, `cd H = 1` and `cd G = ⊤`.
- (c) for the same pair over `ℚ`: `[G : H] = 2` is a unit, so `cd_ℚ G ≤ 1`, and `cd_ℚ G = 1`.
- For `H = 2ℤ ≤ ℤ`, both sides of (b) are `1`.

### 2.4 Extensions and products

Prove that for `N ◁ G`, `cd_R G ≤ cd_R N + cd_R (G ⧸ N)` and `hd_R G ≤ hd_R N + hd_R (G ⧸ N)` in
`ℕ∞` (BieriEckmann1973 line 479–480; CohomologyOfGroups §§6.2–6.3: `E₂^{p,q} = 0` for
`p > cd_R (G ⧸ N)` or `q > cd_R N`, and convergence); hence `cd_R (A × B) ≤ cd_R A + cd_R B`, and an
extension of groups of type `FP` over `R` is of type `FP` (BieriEckmann1974 Proposition 3.3(a),
lines 298–313; 1.7 and 1.2). *Needs:* 2.1, 1.7; CohomologyOfGroups §6.2, §6.3.

**Checks.**

- `cd_R ℤⁿ ≤ n` by induction from `ℤ`, with equality for `R ≠ 0` since `Hₙ(ℤⁿ, R) ≅ Λⁿ(Rⁿ) ≅ R`
  (`TauCeti.groupHomologyPiMultiplicativeIntExteriorPowerEquiv`), so `n ≤ hd_R ≤ cd_R`.
- For `ℤ/2 × ℤ` over `ℤ` the bound is `⊤ + 1 = ⊤`, the true value.
- The Klein bottle group `K = ℤ ⋊ ℤ` (the generator `t` of the quotient acting on `ℤ = ⟨a⟩` by
  `−1`) has `cd_R K ≤ 2`, with equality for `R = 𝔽₂`: as the HNN extension of `⟨a⟩` along
  `a ↦ a⁻¹`, CohomologyOfGroups §3.6 gives `H¹(⟨a⟩, 𝔽₂) → H¹(⟨a⟩, 𝔽₂) → H²(K, 𝔽₂) → H²(⟨a⟩, 𝔽₂) = 0`
  with first map `1 − (−1) = 0` mod `2`, so `H²(K, 𝔽₂) = 𝔽₂`.

### 2.5 Directed unions

Prove: (a) if `G` is the union of a directed family of subgroups `G_i`, then
`hd_R G = sup_i hd_R G_i` (SchemeKTheoryOperations §6.7 and 2.3(a)); (b) if `G` is the union of an
increasing sequence of subgroups `G_0 ≤ G_1 ≤ ⋯`, then `cd_R G ≤ sup_i cd_R G_i + 1`
(BrownGTM87, §VIII.2; the telescope argument below, valid over every `R`, is the proof). Route for
(b): the telescope sequence
`0 → ⊕_i R[G/G_i] → ⊕_i R[G/G_i] → R → 0`, with first map `a ↦ a − (image of a in the next term)`, is
exact because `colim_i R[G/G_i] = R`; its long exact `Ext`-sequence and
`Ext^k_{RG}(⊕_i R[G/G_i], M) ≅ ∏_i Hᵏ(G_i, M)` (CohomologyOfGroups §1.4) give `Hᵏ(G, M) = 0` above
`sup_i cd_R G_i + 1`. *Needs:* 2.1, 2.3; SchemeKTheoryOperations §6.7; CohomologyOfGroups §1.4;
Mathlib `groupCohomologyIsoExt`.

**Checks.**

- For `ℚ = ⋃_i (1/i!)ℤ`: `hd_ℤ ℚ = 1` by (a) and `cd_ℤ ℚ ≤ 2` by (b). The bound is attained: by
  CohomologyOfGroups §5.2, `H²(ℚ, ℤ)` contains `Ext¹_ℤ(H₁(ℚ, ℤ), ℤ) = Ext¹_ℤ(ℚ, ℤ)`, which is the
  cokernel of the countable `Hom(ℚ, ℚ) = ℚ` in the uncountable `Hom(ℚ, ℚ/ℤ)`, hence nonzero; so
  `cd_ℤ ℚ = 2 = hd_ℤ ℚ + 1`.
- The free group of countably infinite rank is the increasing union of free groups of finite rank:
  `hd = 1` by (a), and `cd ≤ 2` by (b), while 2.6 gives the true value `1`.
- (a) needs directedness: `ℤ²` is the union of its cyclic subgroups, each of `hd_ℤ ≤ 1`, while
  `hd_ℤ ℤ² = 2`; the family is not directed.

### 2.6 Amalgams, HNN extensions and free groups

Prove `cd_R (A ∗_C B) ≤ max(cd_R A, cd_R B, cd_R C + 1)`, `cd_R (HNNExtension H A B φ) ≤
max(cd_R H, cd_R A + 1)` and the same for `hd_R`, and that a free group `F` has `cd_R F ≤ 1`, with
equality when `F ≠ 1` and `R ≠ 0` (CohomologyOfGroups §3.6; BrownGTM87, §VIII.2). *Needs:* 2.1;
CohomologyOfGroups §3.6.

**Checks.**

- `cd_R (ℤ ∗ ℤ) = 1` for `R ≠ 0`.
- For `ℤ/4 ∗_{ℤ/2} ℤ/6` over `ℚ` the bound is `max(0, 0, 0 + 1) = 1`, the true value; over `ℤ` it is
  `⊤`.
- For `BS(1, 2)` the bound is `max(1, 2) = 2`.

### 2.7 Finite subgroups and torsion

Prove, for `R` nontrivial: a finite group `H` has `cd_R H = 0` if `|H|` is a unit of `R` and
`cd_R H = ⊤` otherwise; hence every finite subgroup of a group of finite `cd_R` has order invertible
in `R`, a group of finite `cd_ℤ` is torsion-free, and `cd_R G = 0` exactly when `G` is finite of order
invertible in `R` (Brown1974, §3, lines 352–358; BieriEckmann1973 line 61). Route: if `|H|` is a unit,
`1 ↦ |H|⁻¹ Σ_h h` splits the augmentation; otherwise some prime `p ∣ |H|` is not a unit of `R`, `H`
contains an element of order `p`, and `H^{2k}(ℤ/p, R) = R/pR ≠ 0` for all `k ≥ 1`
(`Rep.FiniteCyclicGroup.groupCohomologyIsoEven`), so 2.3(a) applies; if `cd_R G = 0`, a splitting of
the augmentation is an invariant element of `RG` of augmentation `1`, which forces `G` finite and
`|G|` invertible. *Needs:* 2.1, 2.3; Mathlib `Rep.FiniteCyclicGroup.groupCohomologyIsoEven`.

**Checks.**

- `cd_{ℤ[1/2]} (ℤ/2) = 0` and `cd_{ℤ/6} (ℤ/2) = ⊤`: in `ℤ/6`, `2 ≠ 0` but `2` is not a unit, and
  `H²(ℤ/2, ℤ/6) = ℤ/2`. A model asking `|H| ≠ 0` in `R` instead of `|H|` a unit gives `0` here.
- `cd_{ℤ[1/2]} (ℤ/6) = ⊤`, since `3` is not a unit of `ℤ[1/2]`.
- Over the zero ring the dichotomy fails (`cd = 0` for every group), so nontriviality is used.

### 2.8 Comparison with the profinite invariant

Prove that for `G : Type` with the discrete topology, `TauCeti.cohomologicalDimension.{0} G ≤ cd_ℤ G`:
for a discrete torsion `G`-module `M` every action is continuous, and CohomologyOfGroups §1.5
identifies the continuous cohomology with `Hᵏ(G, M)`, which vanishes above `cd_ℤ G`. *Needs:* 2.1;
CohomologyOfGroups §1.5; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.cohomologicalDimension`.

**Checks.**

- For `G = ℤⁿ` both sides are `n`: `Hⁿ(ℤⁿ, ℤ/p) = ℤ/p ≠ 0` for every prime `p`.
- For a nontrivial finite `G` both sides are `⊤`, by `p`-torsion coefficients for a prime `p ∣ |G|`.
- For `G = 1` both sides are `0`.

### Examples

`cd_ℤ` and `hd_ℤ` of `ℤⁿ`, nontrivial free groups and the Klein bottle group are `n`, `1` and `2`,
while the free group of rank `0` is trivial with both equal to `0`; finite nontrivial groups have
both equal to `⊤` over `ℤ` and `0` over `ℚ`; the additive group `ℚ` has `hd_ℤ = 1 < cd_ℤ = 2`.

## Layer 3: tensor induction of complexes and Serre's theorem

### 3.1 Signed tensor induction of complexes

Let `H ≤ G` have finite index `d`, fix a transversal `t_1, …, t_d` of `G ⧸ H`, and for `g ∈ G` write
`g t_i = t_{σ_g(i)} h_i(g)` with `σ_g` a permutation and `h_i(g) ∈ H`. For a chain complex `F` of
`RH`-modules indexed by `ℕ`, define its *tensor induction* `Ind_H^{G,⊗} F`: the graded `R`-module
`F^{⊗_R d}` with total degree, the differential `Σ_i ± 1 ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ d ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ 1` with the Koszul sign of
moving `d` past the factors before it, and the action
`g · (x_1 ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ x_d) = ε · ⊗_j h_{σ_g⁻¹(j)}(g) x_{σ_g⁻¹(j)}`, where `ε = ±1` is the Koszul sign of
permuting the homogeneous factors by `σ_g`. Prove: (a) this is a chain complex of `RG`-modules
(the signs make the action compatible with the differential and with composition in `G`); (b) a
change of transversal gives a naturally isomorphic complex; (c) tensor induction is functorial in
chain maps, and its underlying complex of `R`-modules is `F^{⊗_R d}`, so it carries chain maps that
are `R`-linear homotopy equivalences to `R`-linear homotopy equivalences;
(d) if `F → R` is a resolution of the trivial module by `R`-projective terms, then
`Ind_H^{G,⊗} F → R^{⊗ d} = R` is a resolution of the trivial `RG`-module; (e) if `F_k = 0` for `k > n`
then `(Ind_H^{G,⊗} F)_k = 0` for `k > nd`; (f) if each `F_k` is a free `RH`-module on an `H`-free basis
set, then each `(Ind_H^{G,⊗} F)_k` is a direct sum of modules `Ind_K^G(R_χ)`, where `K` is the
stabilizer of a line spanned by a tensor of basis elements and `χ : K → {±1}` a sign character, and
every such `K` meets the normal core `⋂_g gHg⁻¹` trivially, so is finite. (Brown1974, §6, lines
643–651, for Serre's multiplicative induction of a complex and its fixed points; Serre1971Prospects
n°1.7; BrownGTM87, §VIII.3.) Route: (a)–(b) from the monomial description of the wreath-product
action, as in Tau Ceti's sign-free `Representation.wreathTensor`, with the Koszul sign added; (d)
because a resolution by `R`-projective terms of the projective `R`-module `R` is an `R`-linear
homotopy equivalence `F ≃ R`, and (c); (f) because an element of the core acts on the `i`-th factor
by `t_i⁻¹ g t_i ∈ H`, which fixes no basis element unless it is `1`. *Needs:* Tau Ceti
`Subgroup.tensorInducedRepresentation`, `Representation.wreathTensor`; Mathlib `PiTensorProduct`,
`HomologicalComplex`.

- Tensor induction from `H = G` is the identity functor, and tensor induction is transitive along
  `K ≤ H ≤ G` up to natural isomorphism.
- In degree `0` of a complex concentrated in degree `0` it is `Subgroup.tensorInducedRepresentation`.

**Checks.**

- For `H = 1`, `G = ℤ/2 = ⟨s⟩` and `F = R·x` concentrated in degree `1`, the degree-`2` term is
  `R·(x ⊗ x)` with `s · (x ⊗ x) = −x ⊗ x`: the stabilizer `ℤ/2` acts by the sign character. For
  `F = (R·x → R·y)`, `dx = y`, one has `d(x ⊗ x) = y ⊗ x − x ⊗ y`; the signed action sends `x ⊗ x`
  to `−x ⊗ x` and `y ⊗ x − x ⊗ y` to `x ⊗ y − y ⊗ x`, so it commutes with `d`, while the sign-free
  swap `s'` fixes `x ⊗ x` and also sends `y ⊗ x − x ⊗ y` to its negative, so
  `d s'(x ⊗ x) − s' d(x ⊗ x) = 2(y ⊗ x − x ⊗ y)`. When `2 ≠ 0` in `R` (for instance `R = ℤ`) this is
  nonzero and the model without the Koszul sign is not a chain map; over `𝔽₂` the two models
  coincide, which is why Tau Ceti's sign-free construction is used only in characteristic two.
- For `H = 1`, `G = ℤ/2` and `F = (R →id R)` in degrees `1, 0`, which is contractible, the tensor
  induction is contractible, of length `2 = 1 · 2`.
- For `H = G` and any `F`, the result is `F`.

### 3.2 Serre's theorem

Prove that if `G` is torsion-free (`IsMulTorsionFree G`) and `H ≤ G` has finite index, then
`cd_ℤ G = cd_ℤ H` (Serre1971Prospects n°1.7, Théorème 1, as cited at Brown1974 line 354 and
BieriEckmann1973 line 396; BrownGTM87, §VIII.3). Deduce that a torsion-free group with a finite-index subgroup of type `FP` over
`ℤ` is of type `FP` (BieriEckmann1974 Proposition 3.3(b), lines 300–313). Route: if `cd_ℤ H = n`,
modify a projective resolution of length `n` by the Eilenberg swindle on its top term into a free
resolution of length `n` on `H`-free bases; by 3.1(d)–(f) its tensor induction is a resolution of `ℤ`
over `ℤG` of length `nd` whose terms are sums of `Ind_K^G(ℤ_χ)` with `K` finite, hence `K = 1` and the
terms are free; so `cd_ℤ G < ⊤` and 2.3(b) gives equality. *Needs:* 3.1, 2.3, 2.7, 1.6; Mathlib
`IsMulTorsionFree`.

**Checks.**

- Torsion-freeness is used: `ℤ/2 × ℤ ⊇ 0 × ℤ` has `cd_ℤ = ⊤` against `1`.
- The Klein bottle group contains `ℤ²` with index `2`, and both have `cd_ℤ = 2`.
- For `G = H` the statement is trivial; for `G = ℤ ⊇ dℤ` both sides are `1`.

### Examples

The Klein bottle group and every torsion-free extension of `ℤ` by a finite group have the
cohomological dimension of their finite-index free abelian subgroups; `ℤ/2 × ℤ` shows that the
torsion-free hypothesis cannot be dropped.

## Layer 4: virtual cohomological dimension and virtual finiteness

### 4.1 Virtual cohomological dimension

Define, for `G : Type`, `vcd G` as the infimum in `ℕ∞` of `cd_ℤ H` over the subgroups `H` of finite
index. Prove that if some finite-index subgroup has finite `cd_ℤ`, then `vcd G = cd_ℤ H` for every
finite-index subgroup `H` with `cd_ℤ H < ⊤`, and for every torsion-free finite-index subgroup `H`;
such subgroups exist, and they are exactly the torsion-free finite-index subgroups
(Serre1971Bourbaki lines 77–86; Brown1974, §3, lines 352–358). Route: two finite-index subgroups of
finite `cd` share a finite-index subgroup, so 2.3(b) equates their dimensions; a torsion-free
finite-index subgroup has finite `cd` by 3.2, and a subgroup of finite `cd` is torsion-free by 2.7.
*Needs:* 2.3, 2.7, 3.2.

- `vcd G = 0` exactly when `G` is finite.
- If `cd_ℤ G < ⊤` then `vcd G = cd_ℤ G`.
- `vcd G < ⊤` exactly when `G` is virtually torsion-free with a torsion-free finite-index subgroup
  of finite `cd_ℤ`; `vcd G = ⊤` when no finite-index subgroup is torsion-free.
- `vcd` is invariant under isomorphism.

**Checks.**

- `vcd` of a finite group is `0`, the trivial subgroup having finite index and `cd_ℤ 1 = 0`.
- `vcd (ℤ/2 × ℤⁿ) = n`, through the subgroup `ℤⁿ`, while `cd_ℤ (ℤ/2 × ℤⁿ) = ⊤`.
- `vcd (ℤ/4 ∗_{ℤ/2} ℤ/6) = 1`: the homomorphism to `ℤ/12` given by `×3` on `ℤ/4` and `×2` on `ℤ/6`
  is injective on both factors, so its kernel meets every conjugate of a factor trivially; finite
  subgroups fix a vertex of the Bass–Serre tree (FreeGroupsAndLimitGroups §4.9), so the kernel is
  torsion-free, acts freely and is free (§4.8), nontrivial, of index `12`, with `cd_ℤ = 1`.
- The infinite direct sum `⊕_ℕ ℤ/2` has no torsion-free subgroup of finite index, so its `vcd` is
  `⊤`.

### 4.2 Behaviour under subgroups and extensions

Prove: `vcd H ≤ vcd G` for `H ≤ G`, with equality when `H` has finite index; and for `N ◁ G` with `G`
virtually torsion-free, `vcd G ≤ vcd N + vcd (G ⧸ N)` (BrownGTM87, §VIII.11). Route: intersect with a
torsion-free finite-index subgroup; for the extension, choose `G' ≤ G` torsion-free of finite index
whose image in `G ⧸ N` lies in a torsion-free finite-index subgroup of `G ⧸ N`, and apply 2.4 to
`G' ∩ N ◁ G'`. *Needs:* 4.1, 2.3, 2.4.

**Checks.**

- `vcd (ℤ/2 × ℤ) = 1 = vcd (ℤ/2) + vcd ℤ`.
- `vcd (ℤ/2) = 0 < 1 = vcd (ℤ/2 × ℤ)`, while `cd_ℤ` is `⊤` for both: `vcd` separates the subgroup
  from the group where `cd` does not.
- If `G` is not virtually torsion-free its `vcd` is `⊤` (4.1), so the hypothesis of the extension
  bound is what makes it informative.

### 4.3 Cohomology above the virtual dimension with rational coefficients

Prove that if `vcd G = n < ⊤` and `R` is a commutative ring in which the index of some torsion-free
finite-index subgroup is a unit, in particular every `ℚ`-algebra, then `cd_R G ≤ n`: `Hᵏ(G, M) = 0`
for `k > vcd G` and every `M : Rep R G` (BrownGTM87, §VIII.2). Route: `cd_R H ≤ cd_ℤ H` by base change of
a projective resolution of `ℤ` over `ℤH`, which consists of free `ℤ`-modules and so stays exact, and
2.3(c). *Needs:* 4.1, 2.3, 1.3.

**Checks.**

- For `G = ℤ/2 × ℤ`, `cd_ℚ G = 1 = vcd G`.
- The index hypothesis is used: over `𝔽₂`, `Hᵏ(ℤ/2 × ℤ, 𝔽₂) ⊇ Hᵏ(ℤ/2, 𝔽₂) ≠ 0` for every `k`
  (the projection to `ℤ/2` splits), so `cd_{𝔽₂} = ⊤ > 1`.
- For a finite group, `cd_ℚ = 0 = vcd`.

### 4.4 Virtual finiteness types and finite homological type

Define `G` to be *virtually of type `FP`* (`FL`) when some finite-index subgroup is of type `FP`
(`FL`) over `ℤ`, and to have *finite homological type* when `vcd G < ⊤` and every torsion-free
finite-index subgroup has finitely generated integral homology in every degree (Brown1974, §3,
lines 359–370). Prove: if `vcd G < ⊤`, `G` is virtually of type `FP` exactly when it is of type `FP_∞`
over `ℤ`, and then every torsion-free finite-index subgroup is of type `FP` (Brown1974 lines
359–362); a group virtually of type `FP` has finite homological type; and `G` has finite homological
type exactly when a finite-index subgroup has (Brown1974 Proposition 1, lines 380–384, from the
homological spectral sequence of a torsion-free group over a finite-index normal subgroup,
CohomologyOfGroups §6.3, whose `E²`-terms are homology of a finite group with finitely generated
coefficients). *Needs:* 4.1, 1.6, 1.2, 2.3; CohomologyOfGroups §6.3.

- Virtual types are invariant under isomorphism and pass to and from finite-index subgroups.
- A group of type `FP` over `ℤ` is torsion-free with finite homological type, and its `vcd` is its
  `cd_ℤ`.

**Checks.**

- A finite group has finite homological type and is virtually of type `FL`.
- `ℤ/4 ∗_{ℤ/2} ℤ/6` is virtually of type `FL` through its free subgroup of index `12` (4.1).
- `ℤ/2 × ℚ` has `vcd = 2` but not finite homological type, since `H₁(ℚ, ℤ) = ℚ` is not finitely
  generated; and `ℚ` is not virtually of type `FP` although `vcd ℚ = 2`.

### Examples

Arithmetic groups are the motivating examples (every torsion-free finite-index subgroup of type `FL`,
Brown1974 lines 371–379), and are owned by the arithmetic roadmaps; here the examples are finite
groups, `ℤ/2 × ℤⁿ` and the amalgam `ℤ/4 ∗_{ℤ/2} ℤ/6`.

## Layer 5: geometric dimension, the Eilenberg–Ganea theorem and proper actions

### 5.1 Geometric dimension

Define, for `G : Type u`, the *geometric dimension* `gd G` as the least `n ∈ ℕ∞` such that some
Hausdorff space `X : Type u` with a CW structure on `univ` having no cells of dimension above `n` is a
`K(G, 1)` (`TauCeti.IsEilenbergMacLaneSpaceOne G X x` for some `x`), and `⊤` if there is none
(BrownGTM87, §VIII.7). A `K(G, 1)` CW complex exists for every group (ClassifyingSpaces Stage 2 item
10; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.isEilenbergMacLaneSpaceOne_cellularClassifyingSpace`), so `gd G = ⊤` means that
none is finite dimensional. *Needs:* Mathlib `Topology.CWComplex`; Tau Ceti
`TauCeti.IsEilenbergMacLaneSpaceOne`, `TauCeti.leastENatBound`.

- `gd` is invariant under isomorphism of groups.
- `gd G = 0` exactly when `G` is trivial: a path-connected CW complex without `1`-cells is a point.
- `gd G ≤ n` exactly when a `K(G, 1)` CW complex of dimension at most `n` exists.

**Checks.**

- `gd 1 = 0` (a point) and `gd (FreeGroup S) = 1` for `S` nonempty: the wedge of circles
  (`TauCeti.WedgeSum.isEilenbergMacLaneSpaceOne_circle`) is `1`-dimensional and `gd ≥ cd_ℤ = 1` (5.2).
- `gd ℤⁿ = n`: the product of `n` circles with the product CW structure (`TauCeti.cwComplexProd`) is
  an `n`-dimensional `K(ℤⁿ, 1)`, and `gd ≥ cd_ℤ = n`.
- `gd G = ⊤` for a nontrivial finite group, since `cd_ℤ G = ⊤` (2.7, 5.2).

### 5.2 Cohomological against geometric dimension, and finite classifying spaces

Prove that for `G : Type` and every `R : Type`, `cd_R G ≤ gd G`; that a `K(G, 1)` CW complex with
finitely many cells is a witness that `G` is of type `FL` over every `R`; and that one with finitely
many cells in each dimension `≤ n` makes `G` of type `FP_n` over every `R` (Serre1971Bourbaki 1.2,
lines 55–58; Brown1975, §3, lines 216–231; BrownGTM87, §VIII.7). Route: the lifted cellular chains of
the universal cover are a free resolution of `R` with one generator per cell
(`TauCeti.cellularResolutionOfIsAspherical`, `TauCeti.cellularChainRepIsoFree`; ClassifyingSpaces
Stage 4 item 16). *Needs:* 5.1, 1.2, 2.1; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.cellularResolutionOfIsAspherical`,
`TauCeti.cellularChainRepIsoFree`; ClassifyingSpaces Stage 4 item 16.

**Checks.**

- The torus `T²` with its product structure (one `0`-cell, two `1`-cells, one `2`-cell) gives the
  resolution `0 → Rℤ² → (Rℤ²)² → Rℤ² → R → 0` and `cd_R ℤ² ≤ 2`.
- For the presentation complex of a finite presentation, the finitely many cells of dimension `≤ 2`
  give type `FP_2`, consistent with 1.4(c).
- A finite group has no finite-dimensional `K(G, 1)` CW complex unless it is trivial.

### 5.3 The Eilenberg–Ganea theorem

Prove that `gd G ≤ max(3, cd_ℤ G)` for `G : Type`; hence `gd G = cd_ℤ G` whenever `cd_ℤ G ≥ 3`
(EilenbergGanea1957, main theorem; BrownGTM87, §VIII.7). Route, for `n = max(3, cd_ℤ G)` finite: let
`X` be a `K(G, 1)` CW complex and `Y` its `(n − 1)`-skeleton, which has fundamental group `G` since
`n − 1 ≥ 2` (AlgebraicTopology §8.1). The cellular chains of the universal cover `Ỹ` are exact below
degree `n − 1`, and `Z = ker(∂ : C_{n−1} → C_{n−2}) = H_{n−1}(Ỹ)` is the `n`-th syzygy of a free
resolution of `ℤ`, projective because `cd_ℤ G ≤ n` (2.1). Choose `Q` with `Z ⊕ Q` free and put
`F = (Z ⊕ Q)^{(ℕ)}`, so that `Z ⊕ F ≅ F` (the Eilenberg swindle); wedge `Y` with one
`(n − 1)`-sphere for each element of a basis of `F` (attaching `(n − 1)`-cells along constant maps,
`TauCeti.cellAttachment`), which adds `F` to `C_{n−1}` with zero boundary and makes the new cycle
module `Z ⊕ F` free. The new universal cover is simply connected and `(n − 2)`-connected, so by the
Hurewicz theorem `π_{n−1} = H_{n−1}` (AlgebraicTopology §8.3; Tau Ceti `HomotopyGroup.bijective_hurewicz`);
attach `n`-cells along maps representing a basis of this free module (`TauCeti.cellAttachment`).
The result is `n`-dimensional, has fundamental group `G` (`n ≥ 3`), and its universal cover has
acyclic cellular chains, so it is contractible by the Hurewicz and Whitehead theorems
(AlgebraicTopology §8.5; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.contractibleSpace_of_subsingleton_homotopyGroup`). *Needs:*
5.1, 5.2, 2.1; AlgebraicTopology §8.1, §8.3, §8.5; ClassifyingSpaces Stage 4 item 16; Tau Ceti
`TauCeti.cellAttachment`, `HomotopyGroup.bijective_hurewicz`,
`TauCeti.contractibleSpace_of_subsingleton_homotopyGroup`, `TauCeti.cwComplexPreimage`,
`TauCeti.isEilenbergMacLaneSpaceOne_cellularClassifyingSpace`.

**Checks.**

- For `G = ℤ³` the theorem gives `gd ≤ 3 = cd`, attained by the `3`-torus.
- For `G = ℤ²` it gives only `gd ≤ 3`, while `gd ℤ² = 2` (5.1): the bound `max(3, cd)` is not claimed
  to be attained in dimension `2`, and dimension `1` (the Stallings–Swan theorem) is a non-goal.
- For a nontrivial finite group `cd_ℤ = ⊤`, and the theorem says nothing beyond `gd = ⊤`.

### 5.4 Proper actions on finite-dimensional acyclic simplicial sets

Simplicial sets are Mathlib's `SSet`, with homology `SSet.homology` of the chain complex
`SSet.chainComplex`; a simplicial set is *finite-dimensional* when its nondegenerate simplices have
bounded dimension (`SSet.HasDimensionLE`), and *acyclic* when its integral homology is `ℤ` in degree
`0` (through the augmentation) and zero in positive degrees. Chain-level statements use the
normalized chains `SSet.normalizedChainComplex`, free on the nondegenerate simplices and zero above
the dimension, which compute `SSet.homology` through `SSet.homotopyEquivNormalizedChainComplex`; a
group acting by simplicial automorphisms permutes the nondegenerate simplices and so acts on them
by permutation modules, through `SSet.normalizedChainComplexMap`. Prove:

- (a) for `Γ : Type` with `cd_ℤ Γ < ⊤` there is an acyclic simplicial set `W` whose nondegenerate
  simplices have dimension at most `N = max(3, cd_ℤ Γ)`, with an action of `Γ` by simplicial
  automorphisms that is free on simplices;
- (b) (Serre's construction) for `G : Type` with a finite-index subgroup `Γ` such that
  `cd_ℤ Γ < ⊤` (equivalently `vcd G < ⊤`, 4.1), and `W` as in (a) for `Γ`, the simplicial set
  `Z = Map_Γ(G, W)` whose `k`-simplices are the maps `f : G → W_k` with `f(γx) = γ f(x)` for
  `γ ∈ Γ`, with faces and degeneracies taken pointwise and `G` acting by `(g · f)(x) = f(xg)`, is
  acyclic, its nondegenerate simplices have dimension at most `[G : Γ] · N`, and the stabilizer
  `G_f` of every simplex `f` meets `Γ` trivially, so has order at most `[G : Γ]`; in particular
  every torsion-free subgroup of `G` acts freely on the simplices of `Z`, and the normalized chains
  of `Z` are a resolution of `ℤ` over `ℤΓ'` of length at most `[G : Γ] · N` by free modules for
  every torsion-free `Γ' ≤ G`.

(Brown1974 §6, Lemma, lines 637–651, which states (b) for semi-simplicial complexes together with
the acyclicity of the fixed points of finite subgroups; Serre1971Prospects n°1.7, as cited there.)
Route for (a): 5.3 gives a `K(Γ, 1)` CW complex `B` of dimension at most `N`; AlgebraicTopology
§8.11a replaces `B` up to homotopy equivalence by the realization of an abstract simplicial complex
`K`, of dimension at most `N` (gap:simplicial-replacement-dimension), so `|K|` is a `K(Γ, 1)`; let
`sd K` be the nerve of the poset of simplices of `K`, a simplicial set whose realization is `|K|`,
and `W` the simplicial set whose `k`-simplices are the pairs of a `k`-simplex of `sd K` and a lift of
its realized simplex to the universal covering `TauCeti.UniversalCover` of `|K|` (a covering map by
`TauCeti.UniversalCover.isCoveringMap`, the realization being locally path-connected and
semilocally simply connected), which exists and is determined by the image of one point because the
simplex is simply connected (`IsCoveringMap.existsUnique_continuousMap_lifts`).
The deck group `Γ` acts on the lifts, freely since a deck transformation fixing a lift fixes a point.
The normalized chains of `W` are the lifted cellular chains of the CW structure on `|sd K|` with one
cell per nondegenerate simplex (AlgebraicTopology §4.7), so they form a free resolution of `ℤ` over
`ℤΓ` of length at most `N` (`TauCeti.cellularResolutionOfIsAspherical`,
`TauCeti.cellularChainRepIsoFree`; ClassifyingSpaces Stage 4 item 16), and `W` is acyclic, its
homology `SSet.homology` being that of the normalized chains
(`SSet.homotopyEquivNormalizedChainComplex`). Route for (b): a choice of representatives of `Γ\G`
identifies `Z` with the product of `[G : Γ]` copies of `W`; its chains are homotopy equivalent to
the tensor power of the chains of `W` (Tau Ceti `SSet.eilenbergZilberHomotopyEquiv`, iterated),
which is quasi-isomorphic to `ℤ` by the Künneth formula for complexes of free abelian groups; a
nondegenerate simplex of a product has dimension at most the sum of the dimensions of the factors
(`SSet.hasDimensionLE_prod`). If `γ ∈ Γ` fixes `f`, then `γ f(1) = f(γ) = (γ · f)(1) = f(1)`, so
`γ = 1` by freeness; hence `G_f ∩ Γ = 1`, and `G_f` injects into `Γ\G`. A torsion-free `Γ'` meets
every finite `G_f` trivially, so it permutes the nondegenerate simplices of `Z` freely and the
normalized chains of `Z`, zero above `[G : Γ] · N`, are free over `ℤΓ'`. *Needs:* 5.3, 4.1;
AlgebraicTopology §4.7, §8.11a; gap:simplicial-replacement-dimension; ClassifyingSpaces Stage 4
item 16; Tau Ceti `TauCeti.UniversalCover`, `TauCeti.UniversalCover.isCoveringMap`,
`TauCeti.cellularResolutionOfIsAspherical`, `TauCeti.cellularChainRepIsoFree`,
`SSet.eilenbergZilberHomotopyEquiv`; Mathlib `SSet`, `SSet.chainComplex`, `SSet.homology`,
`SSet.normalizedChainComplex`, `SSet.homotopyEquivNormalizedChainComplex`,
`SSet.normalizedChainComplexMap`, `SSet.hasDimensionLE_prod`,
`IsCoveringMap.existsUnique_continuousMap_lifts`.

- `Z` is functorial in `W` for `Γ`-equivariant simplicial maps, and for `Γ = G` it is `W`.
- For `Γ'` torsion-free and normal of finite index in `G`, the quotient `Z/Γ'` is a
  finite-dimensional simplicial set with integral homology `H_*(Γ', ℤ)`, on which `G ⧸ Γ'` acts
  with the stabilizer of the image of `f` isomorphic to `G_f`.

**Checks.**

- For `G` finite and `Γ = 1`, take `W` a point (`cd_ℤ 1 = 0`): `Z` is a point and its stabilizer is
  all of `G`, of order `[G : 1]`, so the bound on stabilizers is attained.
- For `G = ℤ/2 × ℤ = ⟨s⟩ × ⟨t⟩` and `Γ = ⟨t⟩`, take `W` the line (vertices `ℤ`, edges `i → i + 1`).
  A simplex `f` is the pair `(f(1), f(s))` of simplices of `W`; `t` acts diagonally by translation
  and `s` swaps the two entries (`(s · f)(1) = f(s)`, `(s · f)(s) = f(s²) = f(1)`). So `Z` is the
  plane `W × W`, of dimension `2 = [G : Γ] · 1` although `vcd G = 1`, and the stabilizers are `⟨s⟩`
  on the diagonal and trivial elsewhere: finite, and trivial on the torsion-free subgroup `Γ`.
- The hypothesis `vcd G < ⊤` is used: a torsion-free group acting with finite stabilizers acts
  freely, so the normalized chains of a finite-dimensional acyclic `Z` would resolve `ℤ` by free
  modules in finite length; the free abelian group of countable rank has `cd_ℤ = ⊤` (it contains
  `ℤⁿ` for every `n`, 2.3, 2.4), so it has no such `Z`.

### Examples

Free groups, `ℤⁿ` and finitely presented groups give `gd` from explicit complexes; for groups of
`cd_ℤ ≥ 3`, the Eilenberg–Ganea theorem turns every algebraic computation of `cd_ℤ` into a geometric
one. A group of finite `vcd`, such as `ℤ/2 × ℤ` or `ℤ/4 ∗_{ℤ/2} ℤ/6`, acts with finite stabilizers on
a finite-dimensional acyclic simplicial set (5.4), the input of the denominator theorem 8.9.

## Layer 6: duality groups and Poincaré duality groups

### 6.1 Duality groups

Define `G` to be a *duality group of dimension `n ∈ ℕ` over `R`* with *dualizing module*
`D : Rep R G` and *fundamental class* `e ∈ Hₙ(G, D)` when, for every `M : Rep R G`, the duality map
`x ↦ x ∩ e : Hᵏ(G, M) → Hₙ₋ₖ(G, D ⊗_R M)` of the Conventions is bijective for every `k ≤ n`, and
`Hᵏ(G, M) = 0` for every `k > n` (BieriEckmann1973 Definition 1.1, line 116–121, over `ℤ` with a right
dualizing module and the conventions of lines 122–135; Brown1975 lines 195–199, over `ℤ`; the definition over `R`
replaces `ℤ` by `R` and `ℤG` by `RG` throughout). The vanishing clause replaces the source's convention `H_j = 0` for `j < 0`, which
natural-number subtraction would misread. *Needs:* CohomologyOfGroups §4.6; Mathlib
`groupCohomology`, `groupHomology`, the monoidal structure of `Rep R G`.

- The duality map is natural in `M` and compatible with the connecting maps of short exact sequences
  of coefficients after `D ⊗_R −` when `D` is flat over `R` (CohomologyOfGroups §4.6).
- Being a duality group of dimension `n` over `R` is invariant under isomorphisms of groups, of
  dualizing modules and of fundamental classes.
- With `R` nontrivial, the dimension and the dualizing module are determined by `G` (6.2).

**Checks.**

- `ℤ` is a duality group of dimension `1` over every `R`, with `D = R` and `e` the class of `[t]`;
  the duality map `H¹(ℤ, R) → H₀(ℤ, R)` is `x ↦ x(t)`.
- A finite group of order invertible in `R` is a duality group of dimension `0`, with `D = R` and
  `e = 1 ∈ H₀(G, R) = R`: the duality map `H⁰(G, M) = M^G → H₀(G, M) = M_G` is the composite
  `M^G ↪ M ↠ M_G`, whose inverse is `[m] ↦ |G|⁻¹ Σ_g g·m`, and `Hᵏ(G, M) = 0` for `k > 0` (2.7).
- Over the zero ring every group is a duality group of every dimension with `D = 0`, so the
  consequences in 6.2 assume `R` nontrivial.

### 6.2 Consequences of duality

Prove, for a duality group `G` of dimension `n` over a nontrivial `R` with dualizing module `D` and
fundamental class `e`:

- (a) `Hₙ(G, D) ≅ R`, generated by `e` (the duality isomorphism for `M = R`, `k = 0`);
- (b) `Hᵏ(G, RG) = 0` for `k ≠ n` and `D ≅ Hⁿ(G, RG)` as representations, with the action of the
  Conventions (BieriEckmann1973 Proposition 1.2, lines 139–164; BieriEckmann1974 Proposition 2.1,
  lines 148–154);
- (c) `cd_R G = hd_R G = n` (BieriEckmann1973 Proposition 1.2(iii));
- (d) `G` is of type `FP` over `R` (Brown1975 Corollary 1 of Theorem 3, lines 195–205: `Hᵏ(G, −) ≅
  Hₙ₋ₖ(G, D ⊗_R −)` preserves directed colimits, so 1.5 gives `FP_∞` and (c) gives `FP`); in
  particular `G` is finitely generated (BieriEckmann1973 Theorem 4.6, lines 624–643, by another
  route);
- (e) `D` is flat as an `R`-module (BieriEckmann1973 Proposition 1.6, lines 210–220, torsion-free over
  `ℤ`): for type `FP` with `Hᵏ(G, RG) = 0` for `k ≠ n`, the dual of a finite projective resolution
  resolves `D`, and `D` is `R`-flat exactly when `Hᵏ(G, RG ⊗_R N) = 0` for all `k ≠ n` and all
  `R`-modules `N`; this holds because duality identifies `Hᵏ(G, RG ⊗_R N)` with
  `Hₙ₋ₖ(G, D ⊗_R RG ⊗_R N)`, the homology of an induced module (BieriEckmann1973 Lemma 1.3,
  lines 178–191);
- (f) `D` admits a resolution of length `n` by finitely generated projective `RG`-modules (Brown1975
  Corollary 2 of Theorem 3, lines 208–215).

*Needs:* 6.1, 1.5, 2.2, 2.1; CohomologyOfGroups §4.6.

**Checks.**

- For `ℤ` over `R`: `H¹(ℤ, Rℤ) = Rℤ/(t − 1) ≅ R` with trivial action, so `D = R`, and
  `H⁰(ℤ, Rℤ) = 0`.
- For the free group `F` of rank `r ≥ 2` on `s_1, …, s_r`, `D = H¹(F, RF)` is the cokernel of
  `RF → (RF)^r`, `a ↦ ((s_i − 1)a)_i`: this is `Hom_{RF}(−, RF)` applied to the boundary
  `(a_i)_i ↦ Σ_i a_i(s_i − 1)` of the resolution of 1.8(c), and it is right `RF`-linear, so the
  quotient carries the right multiplication of the Conventions. Over a field `D` has infinite
  dimension, so `F` is a duality group of dimension `1` that is not a Poincaré duality group.
- The order of the factors in that cokernel is forced: for `R ≠ 0` and `F = ⟨s, t⟩`, the vector
  `(s − 1, t − 1)` is the image of `1` under both `a ↦ ((s − 1)a, (t − 1)a)` and
  `a ↦ (a(s − 1), a(t − 1))`. Its right translate `((s − 1)t, (t − 1)t)` is the image of `t` under
  the first map, but not an image under the second: the second coordinate forces `a = t` (no nonzero
  element of `RF` is fixed by right multiplication by `t`, which has infinite order), and then the
  first would need `t(s − 1) = (s − 1)t`, false as `ts ≠ st`. So the second quotient carries no right
  action. For `F = ℤ` both maps give `R[t, t⁻¹]/(t − 1) ≅ R`.
- For a finite group of order invertible in `R`, `H⁰(G, RG) = R·Σ_g g ≅ R` with trivial action.

### 6.3 The duality criterion

Prove: (a) `G` is a duality group of dimension `n` over `R` if and only if `G` is of type `FP` over
`R`, `Hᵏ(G, RG) = 0` for `k ≠ n`, and `Hⁿ(G, RG)` is flat as an `R`-module (BieriEckmann1973
Theorem 4.5, lines 612–621, over `ℤ`, where flat means torsion-free; over `R` the route below, with
`R`-flatness in place of torsion-freeness, is the proof; 6.2 for the converse); (b) without finiteness: `G` is a duality group of dimension `n` over `R` if and only if
`cd_R G < ⊤`, `Hᵏ(G, F) = 0` for `k ≠ n` and every free `RG`-module `F`, `C = Hⁿ(G, RG)` is `R`-flat,
and some `e ∈ Hₙ(G, C)` makes `x ↦ x ∩ e : Hⁿ(G, F) → C ⊗_{RG} F` bijective for every free `F`
(BieriEckmann1973 Theorem 2.3, lines 317–323, with Propositions 2.1–2.2, lines 280–298). Route: (b)
by dimension shifting along free presentations `0 → K → F → A → 0`, where `R`-flatness of `C` keeps
`C ⊗ K → C ⊗ F → C ⊗ A` exact and `Hⱼ(G, C ⊗ F) = 0` for `j > 0` because `C ⊗_R F` is induced
(BieriEckmann1973 Lemma 1.3, lines 178–191); (a) from (b) and 2.2(c), cohomology of a group of type
`FP` commuting with direct sums. *Needs:* 6.1, 6.2, 2.2, 1.2; CohomologyOfGroups §4.6.

**Checks.**

- `ℤⁿ` satisfies (a) over every `R`: type `FL`, `Hᵏ(ℤⁿ, Rℤⁿ) = 0` for `k ≠ n` and `Hⁿ ≅ R` (2.2).
- The vanishing of `Hᵏ(G, RG)` for `k ≠ n` is used: `ℤ ∗ ℤ²` is of type `FP` (1.8, 2.6) with
  `cd = 2`, but the
  free-product sequence of CohomologyOfGroups §3.6 with coefficients `ℤG` embeds
  `H⁰(1, ℤG) = ℤG` into `H¹(ℤ ∗ ℤ², ℤG)`, since `H⁰(ℤ, ℤG) = H⁰(ℤ², ℤG) = 0`; so it is not a duality
  group.
- A finite nontrivial group over `ℤ` fails type `FP`, and indeed is not a duality group.

### 6.4 Poincaré duality groups

Define a *Poincaré duality group of dimension `n` over `R`* as a duality group of dimension `n` over
`R` whose dualizing module is free of rank one as an `R`-module, and its *orientation character*
`w : G →* Rˣ` as the scalar by which `g` acts on `D ≅ R` (independent of the chosen isomorphism, `R`
being commutative); `G` is *orientable* when `w = 1`. The duality then reads
`Hᵏ(G, M) ≅ Hₙ₋ₖ(G, R_w ⊗_R M)` (BieriEckmann1974, §3.1, lines 253–257, over `ℤ`, with the passage between right and left modules
through `sgn` of lines 261–266). Prove, over `ℤ`:
(a) `w` takes values in `{±1}`; (b) if `sgn : G →* {±1}` and isomorphisms
`Hᵏ(G, A) ≅ Hₙ₋ₖ(G, ℤ_sgn ⊗ A)` for `k ≤ n`, not assumed natural or given by a cap product, exist
for every `A`, together with `Hᵏ(G, A) = 0` for `k > n` and `Hⱼ(G, A) = 0` for `j > n`, then `G` is a
Poincaré duality group of dimension `n` with orientation character `sgn` (BieriEckmann1974 Theorem
3.4, lines 327–334). Route for (b): `G` is finitely generated by the argument of BieriEckmann1973
Theorem 4.6 (lines 625–643), which uses only that `Hₙ(G, ℤ_sgn) ≅ H⁰(G, ℤ) = ℤ` and that
`Hₙ(S, ℤ_sgn) ≅ H⁰(G, ℤ[G/S]) = 0` for a finitely generated subgroup `S` of infinite index; then
`Hₖ(G, ∏ ℤG) ≅ ∏ Hₖ(G, ℤG) = 0` for `k ≥ 1` through the given isomorphisms and the commutation of
cohomology with products (BieriEckmann1974 lines 314–323), so `G` is of type `FP_∞` (1.5) and, with
`cd_ℤ G ≤ n`, of type `FP`; `Hᵏ(G, ℤG) = 0` for `k ≠ n` and `Hⁿ(G, ℤG) ≅ ℤ`, so 6.3 applies; finally
the orientation character is `sgn`, because otherwise the true duality for `M = ℤ_{sgn·w}` gives
`0 = H⁰(G, ℤ_{sgn·w}) ≅ Hₙ(G, ℤ_sgn) ≅ ℤ`. *Needs:* 6.1–6.3, 1.5, 2.1.

**Checks.**

- `ℤⁿ` is an orientable Poincaré duality group of dimension `n` over every `R` (6.3, 6.5).
- The Klein bottle group `K = ⟨a, t | t a t⁻¹ = a⁻¹⟩` is a Poincaré duality group of dimension `2`
  over `ℤ` with `w(a) = 1`, `w(t) = −1` (6.5): `H²(K, ℤ) ≅ H₀(K, ℤ_w) = ℤ/2`, while the orientable
  model would give `H₀(K, ℤ) = ℤ`. Over `𝔽₂` it is orientable.
- A finite group is a Poincaré duality group of dimension `0` over `R ≠ 0` exactly when `|G|` is a
  unit of `R`; the free group of rank `r ≥ 1` is one (of dimension `1`) exactly when `r = 1`.

### 6.5 Subgroups of finite index and extensions

Prove: (a) a finite-index subgroup `S` of a duality group `G` of dimension `n` over `R` is a duality
group of dimension `n` over `R` with the restricted dualizing module, and restriction
`Hₙ(G, D) → Hₙ(S, D)` (the transfer) is an isomorphism sending the fundamental class of `G` to that
of `S` (BieriEckmann1973 Theorem 3.2, lines 366–386, from Shapiro's lemma and the projection formula
`tr(y ∩ z) = res y ∩ tr z`); (b) over `ℤ`, a torsion-free group with a finite-index subgroup that is a
duality group of dimension `n` is one (BieriEckmann1973 Theorem 3.3, lines 388–465, with Serre's
theorem 3.2); (c) for `N ◁ G` with `N` and `G ⧸ N` duality groups over `R` of dimensions `n` and `m`,
`G` is a duality group of dimension `n + m` over `R` and `D_G ≅ D_{G⧸N} ⊗_R D_N` with `G` acting
diagonally (BieriEckmann1973 Theorem 3.5 and Proposition 1.8, lines 255–272 and 468–516, over `ℤ`;
over `R` the route below is the proof). Route for (c): CohomologyOfGroups §6.2 collapses for coefficients `A` with
`H^q(N, A) = 0` for `q ≠ n`, the duality isomorphism of `N` is `G ⧸ N`-equivariant (BieriEckmann1973
Proposition 1.8; over `R` the scalar by which `g` moves `e_N` is killed on `D_N`, hence on
`Hₙ(N, D_N) ≅ R`, so it is `1`), and 6.3(b) applies. *Needs:* 6.1–6.3, 3.2; CohomologyOfGroups §1.2,
§4.6, §6.2; Mathlib `groupCohomology.coindIso`, `groupHomology.indIso`.

**Checks.**

- `ℤⁿ⁺¹` is the extension of `ℤ` by `ℤⁿ`, and (c) gives `D = R ⊗ R = R`, recovering 6.4.
- For the Klein bottle group, (c) with `N = ⟨a⟩` and `G ⧸ N = ⟨t⟩` gives
  `D = R ⊗ H¹(⟨a⟩, R⟨a⟩)`, on which `t` acts through conjugation `a ↦ a⁻¹`, by `−1`.
- (b) needs torsion-freeness: `ℤ/2 × ℤ` contains the duality group `ℤ` with index `2` and is not a
  duality group over `ℤ` (`cd_ℤ = ⊤`).

### 6.6 Closed aspherical manifolds

Prove that if `M : Type` is a compact connected Hausdorff (`T2Space M`) smooth manifold without
boundary of dimension `n`, modelled on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`, and is aspherical, then
`G = π₁(M, x)` is a Poincaré duality group of dimension `n` over every `R : Type`, with orientation
character the image in `Rˣ` of the orientation character of `M` (Serre1971Bourbaki 1.4, lines 63–67;
BieriEckmann1974, §3.2, lines 271–281). Mathlib's `ChartedSpace` and `IsManifold` include no
separation axiom, so Hausdorffness is a hypothesis; second countability is not, since a compact
charted space over `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` is covered by finitely many chart domains and is second
countable (`ChartedSpace.secondCountable_of_sigmaCompact`). Route: `M` has finite CW type
(AlgebraicTopology §8.7, for compact Hausdorff second-countable smooth manifolds), so `G` is of type
`FL` (5.2); `M`
is a `K(G, 1)` of CW type, so its cohomology with local coefficients is group cohomology
(ClassifyingSpaces Stage 4 item 17); twisted Poincaré duality with coefficients in the local system
`RG` (AlgebraicTopology §6.4) gives `Hᵏ(G, RG) ≅ Hₙ₋ₖ(G, RG ⊗ R_w)`, which is `0` for `k ≠ n` and
`R_w` for `k = n`, and 6.3(a) applies. *Needs:* 6.3, 6.4, 5.2; AlgebraicTopology §6.3, §6.4, §8.7;
ClassifyingSpaces Stage 4 item 17; Mathlib `ChartedSpace.secondCountable_of_sigmaCompact`.

**Checks.**

- For the torus `(S¹)ⁿ`, aspherical with fundamental group `ℤⁿ`, the conclusion is 6.4's orientable
  case.
- The Klein bottle is a closed non-orientable aspherical surface, and the conclusion is the
  non-orientable character of 6.4.
- Asphericity is used: `S²` is a closed manifold with trivial fundamental group, which is a Poincaré
  duality group of dimension `0`, not `2`.
- Hausdorffness is used: the circle with one point doubled (two copies of the circle glued along the
  complement of a point) is compact, connected and a smooth `1`-manifold in Mathlib's sense, and is
  the union of two open circles meeting in an open interval, so it is weakly equivalent to `S¹ ∨ S¹`:
  aspherical with fundamental group `F₂`. But `F₂` is not a Poincaré duality group of dimension `1`:
  `H¹(F₂, ℤ) = ℤ²`, while `H₀(F₂, ℤ_w)` is `ℤ` or `ℤ/2` for every `w`.

### Examples

Free groups of finite positive rank are duality groups of dimension `1` over every nonzero `R`, and
the free group of rank `0` is the trivial group, a duality group of dimension `0`; `ℤⁿ`, the Klein
bottle group and the
fundamental groups of closed aspherical manifolds are Poincaré duality groups; products and
extensions of duality groups are duality groups. The Borel–Serre duality of torsion-free arithmetic
groups, with the Steinberg module as dualizing module, is an instance owned by ArithmeticKTheory §3.2.

## Layer 7: ranks of projective modules over group rings and Swan's theorem

### 7.1 The Hattori–Stallings rank over a group ring

Define, for a finitely generated projective left `RG`-module `P`, its *Hattori–Stallings rank* `r_P`,
the finitely supported function on the conjugacy classes of `G` with values in `R` obtained from the
Hattori–Stallings trace of EtaleCohomologyFoundations §F.10.3 (applied to `(RG)ᵐᵒᵖ`) through the
`R`-linear isomorphism `RG/[RG, RG] ≅ R^{(G/conj)}`, `Σ a_g g ↦ Σ a_g [g]` (BrownGTM87, §IX.2).
Prove that `[RG, RG]` is the `R`-span of the `g − hgh⁻¹`, so that this map is
an isomorphism, and that `r_P` is: additive in `P` and invariant under isomorphism; equal to
`δ_{[1]}` for `P = RG`; compatible with base change along `R → R'`; compatible with induction from
`H ≤ G`, `r_{RG ⊗_{RH} P}([g]_G) = Σ r_P([h]_H)` over the `H`-classes contained in `[g]_G`; and, for
`H` of finite index, `r_{Res P}([1]) = [G : H] · r_P([1])` (conjugation by coset representatives
preserves the coefficient of `1`); and that `Σ_{[g]} r_P([g])` is the Hattori–Stallings trace of the
projective `R`-module `R ⊗_{RG} P`, its rank when `R` is a field or `ℤ`. *Needs:* EtaleCohomologyFoundations
§F.10.3; Mathlib `MonoidAlgebra`, `ConjClasses`.

- `r_{P ⊕ Q} = r_P + r_Q` and `r_P = r_Q` for `P ≅ Q`.
- `r_{RGⁿ} = n · δ_{[1]}`.
- `r_{R' ⊗_R P}` is the image of `r_P` under `R → R'`.
- For `G` trivial, `r_P([1])` is the trace of the identity of the finite projective `R`-module `P`
  in the sense of `LinearMap.projectiveTrace` (its rank function when `R` is connected).

**Checks.**

- `r_{RG} = δ_{[1]}`, and for `G = ℤ/2` and `H = 1`, induction of `R` gives `RG` with rank `δ_{[1]}`,
  as the induction formula requires.
- For `G` finite with `|G|` a unit and `P = R·e`, `e = |G|⁻¹ Σ_g g` (the trivial module), the rank is
  `r_P([g]) = |[g]|/|G| = 1/|C_G(g)|`; a model that recorded only the rank of `P` over `R` would give
  `δ_{[1]}`.
- For `H = 1 ≤ G` finite and `P = RG`, `Res P = R^{|G|}` and `r_{Res P}([1]) = |G| = [G : 1] · 1`.

### 7.2 Characters of projective modules over finite groups

Prove that for `R` an arbitrary commutative ring, `G` finite and `P` a finitely generated
projective `RG`-module (hence finitely generated projective over `R`, which need not be free), the
trace of `g` on `P` as a finite projective `R`-module, `χ_P(g) = LinearMap.projectiveTrace R P (g · −)`,
is `|C_G(g)| · r_P([g⁻¹])` (BrownGTM87, §IX.2). The trace is Tau Ceti's `LinearMap.projectiveTrace`,
not Mathlib's `LinearMap.trace`, which is `0` on a module without a finite basis. Route: both sides
are additive; for `P = RGᵐ·e` with `e` an idempotent matrix acting on the right, cyclicity
(`LinearMap.projectiveTrace_cyclic`, applied to the projection `v ↦ ve` of `RGᵐ` onto `P` and the
inclusion) identifies `χ_P(g)` with the trace of `v ↦ g v e` on the free `R`-module `RGᵐ`, which is
its Mathlib trace (`LinearMap.projectiveTrace_eq_trace`), and that is `Σ_i Σ_h` (coefficient of `h`
in `g h e_{ii}`), which is `|C_G(g)|` times the sum of the coefficients of `e_{ii}` on the class of
`g⁻¹`. *Needs:* 7.1; Tau Ceti `LinearMap.projectiveTrace`, `LinearMap.projectiveTrace_cyclic`,
`LinearMap.projectiveTrace_eq_trace`; Mathlib `Representation.ofModule'`.

**Checks.**

- For `P = RG`, `χ_P(g) = |G| · [g = 1]` and `|C_G(1)| · r_P([1]) = |G|`.
- For the trivial module `P = R·e` of 7.1, `χ_P(g) = 1 = |C_G(g)| · 1/|C_G(g⁻¹)|`, using
  `|C_G(g)| = |C_G(g⁻¹)|`.
- For `G` trivial both sides are the trace of the identity of `P`. For `R = ℚ × ℚ` and
  `P = R·(1, 0)`, a finitely generated projective `R`-module without a basis (its ranks at the two
  factors are `1` and `0`), both sides are `(1, 0)`: the Hattori–Stallings trace of the idempotent
  `(1, 0)` and the projective trace of the identity. Mathlib's `LinearMap.trace` of the identity is
  `0` there, so a statement with it would be false.
- The inverse in `r_P([g⁻¹])` is forced: for `G = ℤ/3 = ⟨g⟩` over `ℂ`, a character `ζ` with
  `ζ(g) = ω` a primitive cube root of unity, and `P = ℂG·e` with `e = (1/3) Σ_h ζ(h)⁻¹ h`, one has
  `g e = ω e`, so `χ_P(g) = ω`; the coefficient of `g⁻¹` in `e` is `ζ(g⁻¹)⁻¹/3 = ω/3`, and
  `|C_G(g)| · r_P([g⁻¹]) = 3 · ω/3 = ω`, while `r_P([g])` would give `ω⁻¹ ≠ ω`.

### 7.3 Swan's theorem, rational form

Prove that for `G` finite and `P` a finitely generated projective `ℤG`-module: (a) `r_P([g]) = 0` for
`g ≠ 1`; (b) `ℚ ⊗ P ≅ (ℚG)^m` as `ℚG`-modules, with `m = r_P([1]) = rank_ℤ(P)/|G| =
rank_ℤ(ℤ ⊗_{ℤG} P)` (Brown1974, §1, lines 168–172, citing Swan). Route: for `g ≠ 1` choose a prime
`p ∣ orderOf g`; `ℤ_p ⊗ P` is finitely generated projective over `ℤ_p[G]`, and
`TauCeti.trace_ofModule'_eq_zero_of_dvd_orderOf` (with `A = ℤ_p`, local, `p` not a unit) gives
`χ_P(g) = 0`; so the character of `ℚ ⊗ P` is `rank_ℤ(P) · [g = 1]`, the dimension of its invariants
`rank_ℤ(P)/|G|` is a natural number `m`, the characters of `ℚ ⊗ P` and `(ℚG)^m` agree, and
`FDRep.nonempty_iso_of_character_eq` gives (b); (a) follows from 7.2. *Needs:* 7.1, 7.2; Tau Ceti
`TauCeti.trace_ofModule'_eq_zero_of_dvd_orderOf`, `FDRep.nonempty_iso_of_character_eq`; Mathlib
`PadicInt`.

**Checks.**

- For `P = (ℤG)²`, `m = 2 = rank_ℤ(P)/|G|`.
- Projectivity is used: the trivial module `ℤ` over `ℤ/2` has character `1` at the generator, and
  `ℚ` is not a free `ℚ[ℤ/2]`-module.
- For `G` trivial, `m = rank_ℤ P` and the statement is that `ℚ ⊗ P ≅ ℚ^m`.

### 7.4 Swan's theorem modulo `p`

Prove that for `G` finite, `P` a finitely generated projective `ℤG`-module, `p` prime and `m` as in
7.3, `ℤ_p ⊗ P ≅ (ℤ_p G)^m` and `𝔽_p ⊗ P ≅ (𝔽_p G)^m` (Brown1974 Appendix A, lines 1311–1320, the
refinement used in the proof of Theorem 7). Route: `ℚ_p ⊗_{ℤ_p} (ℤ_p ⊗ P) ≅ ℚ_p ⊗_ℚ (ℚ ⊗ P) ≅
(ℚ_p G)^m` by 7.3, so `TauCeti.nonempty_linearEquiv_of_projective_of_tensorRat` gives the first
isomorphism, and reduction modulo `p` the second. *Needs:* 7.3; Tau Ceti
`TauCeti.nonempty_linearEquiv_of_projective_of_tensorRat`.

**Checks.**

- For `P = ℤG` both statements are the identity with `m = 1`.
- Projectivity is used: the trivial module `ℤ` over `G = ℤ/p` reduces to `𝔽_p`, of dimension `1`,
  which is not free over `𝔽_p G` (dimension `p`), and `ℤ_p` is not free over `ℤ_p G`.
- For `p ∤ |G|`, the first isomorphism is also `TauCeti.nonempty_linearEquiv_of_projective_of_tensorRat_of_not_dvd`.

### 7.5 Homomorphisms from a projective module into a finite-dimensional representation

Prove that for a finitely generated group `Γ`, a finitely generated projective `ℤΓ`-module `P`, a
field `K`, a `KΓ`-module `V` of finite dimension and `Γ' ◁ Γ` of finite index, the
`K[Γ/Γ']`-module `Hom_{ℤΓ'}(P, V)` (with `(γ·f)(x) = γ f(γ⁻¹ x)`) is free of rank
`r(P) · dim_K V`, where `r(P) = rank_ℤ(ℤ ⊗_{ℤΓ} P)`; in particular
`dim_K Hom_{ℤΓ}(P, V) = r(P) · dim_K V` (Brown1974 Appendix A, Theorem 7, lines 1284–1355). Route,
following the three cases there: for `Γ` finite, `K ⊗ P` is free over `KΓ` by 7.3 (characteristic
zero) or 7.4 (characteristic `p`); for `K` finite, the action on `V` factors through a finite quotient
and the finite case applies; in general, the finitely many matrices of generators lie in a finitely
generated subring of `K`, whose residue fields at maximal ideals are finite (a field finitely
generated as a ring is finite), so `V` has a `Γ`-stable lattice `L` over a local ring `A ⊂ K` with
finite residue field `k`; `Hom_{ℤΓ'}(P, L)` is finitely generated projective over `A[Γ/Γ']` (it is
induced from `L` when `P = ℤΓ`, Brown1974 Lemma 1), its reduction is free of the stated rank by the
finite case, and a finitely generated projective module over `A[Δ]`, `Δ` finite, whose reduction is
free is free (lift the isomorphism, Nakayama). *Needs:* 7.3, 7.4; Mathlib `IsLocalRing`, Nakayama's lemma,
`Module.Projective`.

**Checks.**

- For `Γ` finite, `Γ' = 1`, `P = ℤΓ` and `V = K`, `Hom_ℤ(ℤΓ, K) = K^Γ ≅ KΓ`, free of rank `1`.
- For `Γ = ℤ = ⟨t⟩`, `Γ' = Γ`, `P = ℤΓ` and `V = K` with `t` acting by `λ`, the dimension is
  `1 = r(ℤΓ) · 1` for every `λ`.
- Projectivity is used: for the trivial module `P = ℤ` over `Γ = ℤ` and `λ ≠ 1`,
  `Hom_{ℤΓ}(ℤ, V) = V^Γ = 0`, while `r(ℤ) · dim V = 1`.

### Examples

For `G = ℤ/p`, the rank of a projective `ℤG`-module is concentrated at the identity, its
rationalization is free, and the dimension of its homomorphisms into any finite-dimensional
representation is computed by its rank alone.

## Layer 8: Euler characteristics

### 8.1 Wall's finiteness lemma

Prove that for a left noetherian ring `A` and a chain complex `C` of projective `A`-modules indexed by
`ℕ` with finitely generated homology in each degree, there is a complex `D` of finitely generated
free modules with a quasi-isomorphism `D → C`, which is a homotopy equivalence; and that if moreover
`Hⁱ(Hom_A(C, M)) = 0` for `i > n` and every finitely generated `M`, then `D` can be chosen with
`D_i = 0` for `i > n` and `D_n` finitely generated projective (Brown1974, §1, Lemma, lines 135–164,
implicit in Wall). Route: build the truncations of `D` and compatible maps inductively, killing the
homology of the mapping cone one degree at a time with finitely many generators (noetherianity keeps
the cycles finitely generated); a quasi-isomorphism of bounded-below complexes of projectives is a
homotopy equivalence; for the second part, the vanishing for `M = D_i/B_i` splits `B_{i−1}` off
`D_{i−1}` above `n`. *Needs:* Mathlib `HomologicalComplex`, `QuasiIso`, `IsNoetherianRing`,
`Module.Projective`.

**Checks.**

- For `C = (F →id F)` with `F = ℤ^{(ℕ)}` in degrees `1, 0`, the homology is zero and `D = 0`.
- Noetherianity is used: over `k[x₁, x₂, …]`, a projective resolution of `k` has finitely generated
  homology but `k` is not finitely presented, so no such `D` exists.
- For a finitely generated free resolution of a module the lemma returns it up to homotopy.

### 8.2 Finite groups acting on complexes of projective modules

Prove that for a finite group `G` and a finite-dimensional chain complex `C` of projective
`ℤG`-modules with finitely generated homology, `C_G = ℤ ⊗_{ℤG} C` has finitely generated homology,
`χ(C) = |G| · χ(C_G)` (Euler characteristics of the ranks of homology), and the Lefschetz number
`Σ_i (−1)ⁱ tr(g | Hᵢ(C) ⊗ ℚ)` vanishes for `g ≠ 1` (Brown1974, §1, Theorem 1, lines 125–172). Route:
8.1 over the noetherian ring `ℤG` replaces `C` by a finite complex `D` of finitely generated
projectives, and 7.3 makes each `ℚ ⊗ D_i` free of rank `m_i`, so both Euler characteristics and the
Lefschetz numbers are computed on chains. *Needs:* 8.1, 7.3.

**Checks.**

- For `G = ℤ/2` and `C = ℤG` in degree `0`: `χ(C) = 2 = 2 · χ(ℤ)`, and the Lefschetz number at the
  generator is `0`.
- Projectivity is used: for the trivial module `ℤ` in degree `0`, `χ(C) = 1 ≠ 2 · χ(C_G) = 2`.
- For the cellular chains of the circle with `ℤ/2` acting by the rotation of order `2` (free on
  cells), `χ(C) = 0 = 2 · χ(circle)`.

### 8.3 The rational Euler characteristic and the identity-class rank

Define, for a group with `H_*(G, ℚ)` of finite total dimension, `χ_ℚ(G) = Σᵢ (−1)ⁱ dim_ℚ Hᵢ(G, ℚ)`
(Brown1974, §4, lines 386–387; this is the invariant Brown1974 calls the naive Euler characteristic,
lines 82–83). For `G` of type `FP` over `ℤ` and a finite projective resolution `P` of the trivial
`ℤG`-module, define `χ̃(G) = Σᵢ (−1)ⁱ r_{Pᵢ}([1]) ∈ ℤ`, the alternating sum of the identity-class
coefficients of the Hattori–Stallings ranks of 7.1 (the ranks as in BrownGTM87, §IX.2). Prove: `χ̃(G)` does not depend on `P` (generalized Schanuel lemma and the additivity of 7.1);
`χ̃(H) = [G : H] · χ̃(G)` for `H` of finite index (7.1); for type `FP`,
`χ_ℚ(G) = Σᵢ (−1)ⁱ Σ_{[g]} r_{Pᵢ}([g]) = Σᵢ (−1)ⁱ rank_ℤ(ℤ ⊗_{ℤG} Pᵢ)`; and for type `FL`,
`χ_ℚ(G) = χ̃(G) = Σᵢ (−1)ⁱ rank Fᵢ` (Brown1974 lines 402–410). *Needs:* 7.1, 1.2; Tau Ceti's Schanuel
lemma `TauCeti.exists_linearEquiv_comp_fst_eq_comp_snd_comp`.

- `χ_ℚ` and `χ̃` are invariant under isomorphism of groups, and `χ_ℚ(1) = χ̃(1) = 1`.
- `χ_ℚ(G) = Σ(−1)ⁱ dim Hⁱ(G, ℚ)` by universal coefficients over `ℚ`.

**Checks.**

- `χ_ℚ(ℤ) = χ̃(ℤ) = 1 − 1 = 0`, `χ_ℚ(F_r) = 1 − r` from `0 → ℤF^r → ℤF → ℤ → 0`, and
  `χ_ℚ(ℤⁿ) = Σ_k (−1)ᵏ (n choose k) = 0` for `n ≥ 1`.
- For a finite group `G`, `χ_ℚ(G) = 1` for every order, so `χ_ℚ` does not see the order of a finite
  group (compare `χ` in 8.4). For a nontrivial finite group `χ̃` is not defined (`cd_ℤ G = ⊤` by
  2.7, so there is no finite projective resolution over `ℤ`): for `G = ℤ/2` one has `χ_ℚ = 1`,
  `χ = 1/2` and no `χ̃`. For `G = 1` the resolution `0 → ℤ → ℤ → 0` of length `0` gives
  `χ̃(1) = 1 = χ_ℚ(1) = χ(1)`.
- For the additive group `ℚ`, `χ_ℚ(ℚ) = 1 − 1 = 0` although `ℚ` is not of type `FP_1`.

### 8.4 Normal subgroups of finite index and groups of finite homological type

Prove: (a) if `cd_ℤ Γ < ⊤` and `Γ' ◁ Γ` has finite index with finitely generated integral homology,
then `H_*(Γ, ℚ)` is finite-dimensional and `χ_ℚ(Γ') = [Γ : Γ'] · χ_ℚ(Γ)` (Brown1974, §4, Theorem 3,
lines 388–401: apply 8.2 to `ℤ ⊗_{ℤΓ'} P` for a finite projective resolution `P` over `ℤΓ`); (b)
for `G` of finite homological type, `χ(G) = χ_ℚ(H)/[G : H]` does not depend on the torsion-free
finite-index subgroup `H` (Brown1974 lines 411–424: compare through a torsion-free normal subgroup of
finite index contained in two of them, using (a)); (c) `χ(H) = [G : H] · χ(G)` for every finite-index
`H` (which has finite homological type by 4.4); `χ(G) = χ_ℚ(G) ∈ ℤ` when `G` is torsion-free; and
`χ(G) = χ̃(G) = Σᵢ (−1)ⁱ rank Fᵢ` for `G` of type `FL`; (d) `χ` is the unique `ℚ`-valued function on
groups virtually of type `FL` that is multiplicative on finite-index subgroups and given by the ranks
of a finite free resolution for type `FL`, so it is the Euler characteristic of Wall and Serre
(Brown1974 lines 402–410; Serre1971Bourbaki lines 77–86; Wall1961; Serre1971Prospects n°1.8).
*Needs:* 8.2, 8.3, 4.1, 4.4, 2.3.

- `χ` is invariant under isomorphism, and `χ(G) = 1/|G|` for `G` finite.

**Checks.**

- `χ(G) = 1/|G|` for a finite group, against `χ_ℚ(G) = 1`.
- `χ(ℤ/2 × ℤ) = χ(ℤ)/2 = 0`.
- `χ(ℤ/4 ∗_{ℤ/2} ℤ/6) = χ_ℚ(K)/12 = −1/12` for its free kernel `K` of index `12` (4.1), whose rank is
  `2` by the count of 8.7: the two computations agree.

### 8.5 Twisted coefficients

Prove that for `G` of type `FP` over `ℤ`, a field `K` and a `KG`-module `V` of finite dimension,
`Σᵢ (−1)ⁱ dim_K Hⁱ(G, V) = χ(G) · dim_K V`; and that for `Γ' ◁ G` of finite index the virtual
character of `G/Γ'` on `H*(Γ', V)` is `χ(G) · dim_K V` times the regular character (Brown1974, §4,
Theorem 4 and Corollary 1, lines 425–451, over a field of characteristic zero there; Theorem 7 gives
every field). Route: compute on `Hom_{ℤΓ'}(P, V)` for a finite projective resolution `P`, use 7.5
(a group of type `FP` is finitely generated, 1.4) and `Σ(−1)ⁱ r(Pᵢ) = χ_ℚ(G) = χ(G)` (8.3, 8.4).
*Needs:* 7.5, 8.3, 8.4, 1.4.

**Checks.**

- For `G = ℤ` and `V = K` with `t` acting by `λ`: if `λ ≠ 1` both `H⁰` and `H¹` vanish, if `λ = 1`
  both are `K`; in both cases the sum is `0 = χ(ℤ)`.
- For `G = F_2` and trivial `V = K`: `1 − 2 = −1 = χ(F_2)`.
- Type `FP` is used: for `G = ℤ/2` and `V = ℚ`, the sum is `1` while `χ(ℤ/2) · 1 = 1/2`.

### 8.6 Extensions

Prove that if `N ◁ G`, `N` and `G ⧸ N` are virtually of type `FP` and `G` is virtually torsion-free,
then `G` is virtually of type `FP` and `χ(G) = χ(N) · χ(G ⧸ N)` (Brown1974, §4, Corollary 2,
lines 452–463). Route: pass to a torsion-free finite-index subgroup `Γ` of `G` whose intersection
`Γ ∩ N` and image `Q` in `G ⧸ N` are of type `FP` (4.4, 8.4(c)); it is of type `FP` (2.4). The
spectral sequence of CohomologyOfGroups §6.2 for `Γ ∩ N ◁ Γ` with coefficients `ℚ`,
`E₂^{p,q} = Hᵖ(Q, H^q(Γ ∩ N, ℚ))`, is the spectral sequence of a filtration of the normalized
cochains that is finite in each degree (CohomologyOfGroups §6.1); its `E₂`-page is zero unless
`p ≤ cd_ℤ Q` and `q ≤ cd_ℤ(Γ ∩ N)`, its terms are finite-dimensional, and by 8.5 its alternating row
sums are `χ(Q) · dim H^q(Γ ∩ N, ℚ)`. The Euler characteristic identity of SpectralSequencesAndConvergence
§5.3, with the finite-dimensional `ℚ`-vector spaces as weak Serre class and the dimension as
additive invariant, applied on the classical `E₂` (its native page `3`), gives
`χ_ℚ(Γ) = Σ_{p,q} (−1)^{p+q} dim E₂^{p,q} = χ(Q) · χ_ℚ(Γ ∩ N)`; dividing by
`[G : Γ] = [G ⧸ N : Q] · [N : Γ ∩ N]` gives the product (8.4). *Needs:* 8.4, 8.5, 4.4, 2.4;
CohomologyOfGroups §§6.1–6.2; SpectralSequencesAndConvergence §5.3.

**Checks.**

- `χ(ℤ/2 × ℤ) = χ(ℤ/2) · χ(ℤ) = 0`.
- `χ(F_2 × F_3) = (−1)(−2) = 2`, also `χ_ℚ` of the product by the Künneth formula. With `N = F_3`,
  the `E₂`-terms `H⁰(F_2, ℚ) ⊗ H^q(F_3, ℚ)` and `H¹(F_2, ℚ) ⊗ H^q(F_3, ℚ)` have dimensions `1, 3`
  and `2, 6`, so the total degrees `0, 1, 2` carry dimensions `1, 5, 6` and the supplied Euler
  identity gives `1 − 5 + 6 = 2`.
- For the Klein bottle group as an extension of `ℤ` by `ℤ`, `χ = 0 · 0 = 0`.

### 8.7 Actions on acyclic complexes, amalgams and HNN extensions

Prove that if `G` has finite homological type and `C` is a finite-length resolution of `ℤ` over `ℤG`
with `C_p ≅ ⊕_{σ ∈ Σ_p} Ind_{G_σ}^G(ℤ_σ)`, each `Σ_p` finite, each `ℤ_σ` given by a character
`G_σ → {±1}` and each `G_σ` of finite homological type, then
`χ(G) = Σ_p (−1)^p Σ_{σ ∈ Σ_p} χ(G_σ)`. In particular, for a simplicial action of `G` on an acyclic
simplicial complex with finitely many simplices modulo `G` and simplex stabilizers of finite
homological type, `χ(G)` is the equivariant Euler characteristic `Σ_σ (−1)^{dim σ} χ(G_σ)` over
representatives `σ` of the simplices (Brown1974, §5, lines 464–479, Proposition 2(i), line 509, and
Proposition 4, lines 558–582; Serre1971Prospects n°1.8, Proposition 14(b)). Deduce, for amalgams and
HNN extensions of finite homological type whose vertex and edge groups have finite homological type,
`χ(A ∗_C B) = χ(A) + χ(B) − χ(C)` and `χ(HNNExtension H A B φ) = χ(H) − χ(A)`, from the Bass–Serre
tree (CohomologyOfGroups §3.4; FreeGroupsAndLimitGroups §§4.5, 4.7). Route: restrict to a torsion-free
normal subgroup `Γ'` of finite index, decomposing each `Ind_{G_σ}^G` over the double cosets
`Γ'\G/G_σ`; the orbit spectral sequence of CohomologyOfGroups §3.2 with rational coefficients,
`E¹_{p,q} = ⊕ H_q(Γ'_σ, ℚ_σ) ⇒ H_{p+q}(Γ', ℚ)`, converging with filtrations finite in each total
degree (CohomologyOfGroups §2.3, where it is the spectral sequence of the row filtration of a
first-quadrant bicomplex), has finitely many nonzero `E¹`-terms, all finite-dimensional, so the
Euler identity of SpectralSequencesAndConvergence §3.4, in its filtered-complex form §5.3 (the
finite-dimensional `ℚ`-vector spaces and their dimension), gives `χ_ℚ(Γ')`; a character `ε` of a
torsion-free group `T` of finite homological type does not change it, `χ_ℚ(T; ℚ_ε) = χ_ℚ(T)`, by
8.4(a) for `ker ε`. *Needs:* 8.4, 4.4; CohomologyOfGroups §§2.3, 3.2, 3.4;
SpectralSequencesAndConvergence §§3.4, 5.3; FreeGroupsAndLimitGroups §4.5, §4.7.

**Checks.**

- `χ(ℤ/4 ∗_{ℤ/2} ℤ/6) = 1/4 + 1/6 − 1/2 = −1/12`, so its free kernel of index `12` has
  `χ = −1`, rank `2` (8.4). With the sign of the edge term reversed the amalgam would give
  `11/12`, which is not `χ_ℚ(K)/12` for any free `K`.
- `χ(ℤ/2 ∗ ℤ/3) = 1/2 + 1/3 − 1 = −1/6`, the value FuchsianOrbifolds Layer 5 item 6 gives for the
  orbifold Euler characteristic of `PSL(2, ℤ)`.
- The free group on `r` generators acts on its Cayley tree with one vertex orbit and `r` edge orbits,
  all stabilizers trivial: `1 − r`. `BS(1, 2)` as an HNN extension of `ℤ` over `ℤ` gives `0 − 0 = 0`.

### 8.8 Smith theory and orbit counting

Let a finite group `G` act by simplicial automorphisms on a finite-dimensional simplicial set `X`
(5.4). For `H ≤ G` the `H`-fixed simplices form a simplicial subset `X^H`, a face of a fixed simplex
being fixed, and `X/H` is the orbit simplicial set. Homology is `SSet.homology`; with coefficients in
`𝔽_p`, `χ_p(Y) = Σᵢ (−1)ⁱ dim_{𝔽_p} Hᵢ(Y; 𝔽_p)` whenever the total dimension is finite. Chains are
the normalized chains `N(Y) = SSet.normalizedChainComplex` (5.4), zero above the dimension of `Y`
(`SSet.isZero_normalizedChainComplex_X_of_hasDimensionLT`) and computing `SSet.homology`
(`SSet.homotopyEquivNormalizedChainComplex`); `G` acts on `N(X)` through
`SSet.normalizedChainComplexMap`, permuting the basis of nondegenerate simplices. Prove first the two
compatibilities the arguments below use: for `H ≤ G`, a simplex of `X^H` is degenerate in `X^H` if
and only if it is degenerate in `X` (if `x = s_i y` then `y = d_i x` is `H`-fixed), so `N(X^H)` is
the subcomplex of `N(X)` spanned by the `H`-fixed nondegenerate simplices, and for a union of fixed
simplicial subsets the relative normalized chains are spanned by the nondegenerate simplices outside
it; and the image in `X/H` of a nondegenerate simplex is nondegenerate (if `[x] = s_i[y]` then
`x = h · s_i y = s_i(h · y)` for some `h ∈ H`), so `N(X/H)` is the module of `H`-coinvariants
`ℤ ⊗_{ℤH} N(X)`, compatibly with the differentials. Prove:

- (a) (Smith, Floyd) for a prime `p`, `G = ℤ/p` and `Σᵢ dim Hᵢ(X; 𝔽_p) < ∞`: `X^G` and `X/G` have
  finite total mod-`p` homology, `Σ_{i ≥ n} dim Hᵢ(X^G; 𝔽_p) ≤ Σ_{i ≥ n} dim Hᵢ(X; 𝔽_p)` for every
  `n`, and `χ_p(X) + (p − 1) χ_p(X^G) = p χ_p(X/G)` (Floyd1952 Theorem 4.2, lines 292–330, and
  Theorem 4.4, lines 333–348, for locally compact finite-dimensional Hausdorff spaces; the proof
  rests on the chain-level Smith sequences (A) and (B) of Floyd1952 Theorems 2.3–2.4, lines 110–176,
  stated for a simplicial action of prime period whose fixed points form a subcomplex, and on
  Smith's facts (3.4)–(3.6), lines 261–267: the special homology vanishes above the dimension, and
  the special homology relative to the fixed points is the homology of the orbit space relative to
  the image of the fixed points);
- (b) for a finite `p`-group `G` with `Σᵢ dim Hᵢ(X; 𝔽_p) < ∞`, every `X^H`, `H ≤ G`, has finite total
  mod-`p` homology (Brown1974 lines 327–333, which attributes this to Smith theory);
- (c) for a finite `p`-group `G` and a finite-dimensional chain complex `C` of projective
  `𝔽_p[G]`-modules with finite total homology, `C_G = 𝔽_p ⊗_{𝔽_p[G]} C` has finite total homology
  and `χ(C) = |G| · χ(C_G)` (Brown1974 Theorem 1′, lines 174–185);
- (d) (Brown) if every `Hᵢ(X; ℤ)` is finitely generated (they vanish above the dimension of `X`,
  `SSet.isZero_homology_of_hasDimensionLT`),
  and an integer `d ≥ 1` divides the cardinality of the `G`-orbit of every nondegenerate simplex of
  `X`, then
  `d ∣ χ(X) = Σᵢ (−1)ⁱ rank Hᵢ(X; ℤ)` (Brown1974 §2, Corollary of Theorems 2 and 2′, lines 251–260,
  with `X′` empty).

Route: (a) as in Floyd1952 §§2 and 4, whose chain-level arguments apply verbatim to a simplicial
set, since for `G = ℤ/p` a nondegenerate simplex is either fixed or has `p` distinct translates, so
the normalized chains of `X` over `𝔽_p` are those of `X^G` plus free `𝔽_p[G]`-modules; for a
simplicial set Smith's facts (3.4)–(3.6) hold at the chain level, the normalized chains vanishing
above the dimension of `X` and the norm `1 + g + ⋯ + g^{p−1}` identifying the free part modulo
`1 − g` with the normalized chains of `X/G` relative to the image of `X^G` (the compatibilities
above); (b) by (a) along a chain `1 = H₀ < H₁ < ⋯ < H_r = H`
with each `H_{i−1}` normal in `H_i` of index `p`, as `X^{H_i} = (X^{H_{i−1}})^{H_i/H_{i−1}}`; (c)
because `𝔽_p[G]` is local, so projective modules are free, and 8.1 over the noetherian ring
`𝔽_p[G]` (the vanishing hypothesis holds above the dimension of `C`) replaces `C` by a bounded
complex of finitely generated free modules, on which both sides are computed from ranks; (d) for
each prime `p` with `p^e ∥ d`, restrict to a Sylow `p`-subgroup `P`, whose orbits all have
cardinality divisible by `p^e`; decompose `X` by isotropy type, `X_H` being the simplices with
stabilizer exactly `H`, a difference of the simplicial subsets `X^H` and `⋃_{H′ > H} X^{H′}`, which
have finite mod-`p` homology by (b) and Mayer–Vietoris (the family of fixed simplicial subsets is
closed under intersection); `N_P(H)/H` acts freely on the basis of the relative normalized chains
of `X_H`, a finite-dimensional complex of free `𝔽_p[N_P(H)/H]`-modules, so (c) gives
`χ_p(X_H) = (N_P(H) : H) · χ_p(Y_H)` with `Y_H = X_H/N_P(H)`, and additivity along the filtration of
`X` by `P`-invariant simplicial subsets gives `χ_p(X) = Σ_H (P : H) · χ_p(Y_H)` over representatives
`H` of the occurring conjugacy classes of isotropy groups (Brown1974 lines 261–326, applying its
Theorem 1 to the normalized chain complex at line 302); every term is
divisible by `p^e`; finally
`χ_p(X) = χ(X)` by universal coefficients, the integral homology being finitely generated. *Needs:*
8.1; Mathlib `SSet`, `SSet.homology`, `SSet.normalizedChainComplex`,
`SSet.homotopyEquivNormalizedChainComplex`, `SSet.normalizedChainComplexMap`,
`SSet.isZero_normalizedChainComplex_X_of_hasDimensionLT`, `SSet.isZero_homology_of_hasDimensionLT`,
`Sylow`.

- The Smith inequality of (a) with `n = 0` bounds the total mod-`p` homology of `X^G` by that of `X`;
  in particular, for a finite `p`-group acting on a finite-dimensional simplicial set with the mod-`p`
  homology of a point, `X^G` has the mod-`p` homology of a point (by (a) and Floyd's relation, its
  Euler characteristic is `1 mod p`, so it is nonempty).
- For `G = ℤ/p` acting without fixed simplices, (a) and (d) with `d = p` agree:
  `χ_p(X) = p χ_p(X/G)`.

**Checks.**

- Floyd's relation, with fixed points: let `X` be the circle with vertices `v₀, v₁, v₂, v₃` and edges
  `v₀ → v₁`, `v₂ → v₁`, `v₀ → v₃`, `v₂ → v₃`, and `ℤ/2` swap `v₁` and `v₃`. Then `X^G = {v₀, v₂}`
  (`χ = 2`, total dimension `2 ≤ 2`), `X/G` is the path `v₀ → [v₁] ← v₂` (`χ = 1`), and
  `0 + (2 − 1) · 2 = 2 · 1`. A relation without the fixed-point term would give `0 = 2`.
- Free actions: on the same `X` let `ℤ/2` swap `v₀ ↔ v₂` and `v₁ ↔ v₃`. It acts freely, `X/G` is a
  circle with two vertices and two edges, and `0 + 0 = 2 · 0`; every orbit has two elements and
  `2 ∣ χ(X) = 0`, as (d) says. On the subdivided interval (vertices `v₀, v₁, c`, edges `v₀ → c` and
  `v₁ → c`) with `v₀ ↔ v₁` swapped, `χ = 1`, the fixed vertex `c` has an orbit of one element, and
  `X^G = {c}` has the homology of a point, as Smith theory requires.
- Finite dimension is used: `ℤ/2` acts freely on the contractible simplicial set `E(ℤ/2)` whose
  `k`-simplices are the `(k + 1)`-tuples of elements of `ℤ/2`, so every orbit has two elements, while
  its Euler characteristic is `1`, not divisible by `2`; it has nondegenerate simplices in every
  dimension.
- Normalized, not unnormalized, chains: for `X = Δ[0]` the unnormalized chains `SSet.chainComplex`
  are `ℤ` in every degree, with `d_n` the alternating sum of `n + 1` identities, so `d₁ = 0` and
  `d₂ = id`, while the normalized chains are `ℤ` in degree `0` and `0` above. Both give `H₀ = ℤ` and
  `Hᵢ = 0` for `i > 0`, but only the normalized complex has finite length, as (a), (c), (d) and 5.4
  require; a chain model counting degenerate simplices would make every complex of this section
  unbounded.
- Finite total homology of `X` is used in (b): `ℤ/2` acting trivially on the discrete simplicial set
  `ℕ` (dimension `0`) has `X^G = X` with `H₀(X^G; 𝔽₂) = 𝔽₂^{(ℕ)}` of infinite dimension, and is
  excluded because `H₀(X; 𝔽₂)` is infinite as well. For a point both totals are `1`; for the
  reflection of the circle above the total for `X` is `2` and for `X^G` it is `2`.

### 8.9 Denominators

Prove that if `G` has finite homological type (4.4) and `m` is the least common multiple of the orders
of the finite subgroups of `G`, then `m · χ(G) ∈ ℤ`; equivalently, every prime power dividing the
denominator of `χ(G)` is the order of a subgroup of `G` (Brown1974, §6, Corollary 1 of Theorem 5,
lines 603–610, the case of the empty family; Serre1971Prospects n°1.8, Proposition 13, as cited at
Brown1974 lines 611–614, for the weaker statement that some power of `m` works). The least common
multiple exists: for a torsion-free normal subgroup `Γ'` of finite index (the normal core of a
torsion-free finite-index subgroup, 4.1), every finite subgroup of `G` meets `Γ'` trivially, so its
order divides `[G : Γ']`. Route: let `Q = G ⧸ Γ'` and `Z` the simplicial set of 5.4(b); `Γ'` acts
freely on `Z`, so `X = Z/Γ'` is a finite-dimensional simplicial set whose normalized chains are
those of `Z` tensored over `ℤΓ'` with `ℤ` (8.8); as the normalized chains of `Z` are a free
resolution of `ℤ` over `ℤΓ'` (5.4(b)), `Hᵢ(X; ℤ) ≅ Hᵢ(Γ', ℤ)` (`groupHomologyIsoTor`), finitely
generated as `G` has finite homological type, and `χ(X) = χ_ℚ(Γ')`. The group `Q` acts on `X`, and the
stabilizer of the image of a simplex `z` is the image of `G_z`, isomorphic to `G_z` since
`G_z ∩ Γ' = 1`; its order divides `m`, and `m` divides `|Q|`, so `d = |Q|/m` divides the cardinality
of every `Q`-orbit. By 8.8(d), `d ∣ χ_ℚ(Γ')`, and `m · χ(G) = m · χ_ℚ(Γ')/|Q| = χ_ℚ(Γ')/d ∈ ℤ`
(8.4(b)). The equivalence: if `mχ(G) ∈ ℤ`, a prime power `p^a` dividing the denominator divides
`m`, hence the order of a finite subgroup, which has a subgroup of order `p^a` by Sylow's theorem;
conversely each prime power exactly dividing the denominator then divides `m`. *Needs:* 8.8, 8.4,
5.4, 4.1, 4.4; Mathlib `groupHomologyIsoTor`, `Sylow`.

- If `G` acts on an acyclic simplicial complex with finitely many orbits of simplices and finite
  stabilizers (more generally, `C` as in 8.7 with every `G_σ` finite), then 8.7 gives
  `χ(G) = Σ_σ (−1)^{dim σ}/|G_σ|`, so `m_C · χ(G) ∈ ℤ` for the least common multiple `m_C` of the
  stabilizer orders, which divides `m`; and `G` is then virtually of type `FL`, a torsion-free
  finite-index subgroup acting freely with finitely many orbits.
- For `G` torsion-free, `m = 1` and the statement is `χ(G) ∈ ℤ` (8.4(c)).

**Checks.**

- For `ℤ/4 ∗_{ℤ/2} ℤ/6`, the finite subgroups are conjugate into a factor (FreeGroupsAndLimitGroups
  §4.9), of orders `1, 2, 3, 4, 6`, so `m = 12` and `12 · (−1/12) = −1`; the denominator `12 = 4 · 3`
  gives subgroups of orders `4` and `3`. A model with `m` the largest order of a finite subgroup
  would give `6 · (−1/12) = −1/2 ∉ ℤ`.
- For `ℤ/2 ∗ ℤ/3`, `m = 6` and `6 · (−1/6) = −1`, while the largest finite order `3` gives
  `3 · (−1/6) = −1/2`.
- For `G` finite, `m = |G|` and `|G| · 1/|G| = 1`; for `ℤ/2 × ℤ`, whose finite subgroups have order
  at most `2`, `m = 2` and `2 · 0 = 0`.

### Examples

`χ(SL₂(ℤ)) = −1/12` (Serre1971Bourbaki line 214) is the value of 8.7 on `ℤ/4 ∗_{ℤ/2} ℤ/6`, which is
`SL₂(ℤ)` by Serre's theorem on its action on a tree; the identification is not a target here, and
the Checks are stated for the amalgam.

## Layer 9: complete resolutions and Farrell cohomology

Throughout, `G` has a subgroup `H` of finite index with `cd_R H ≤ n < ⊤`. Over `ℤ` this says that
`vcd G ≤ n` (4.1), and for every `R` it holds with `n = vcd G` when `vcd G < ⊤`, by base change as in
4.3.

### 9.1 Modules projective over a subgroup of finite index are Gorenstein projective

Prove that a representation `M : Rep R G` whose restriction to `H` is projective is
Gorenstein projective in `Rep R G` (`CategoryTheory.isGorensteinProjective`) (BrownGTM87, §X.2;
Farrell1977). Route: the unit `M → Coind_H^G Res M` is injective and split over `H`, its target is
projective over `RG` because `Coind_H^G = Ind_H^G` at finite index and `Res M` is projective, and its
cokernel is again projective over `H`; iterating gives a right resolution by projectives with
`H`-projective cokernels, and any projective resolution of `M` has `H`-projective syzygies; for `Z`
projective over `H` and `Q` projective over `G`, `Ext¹_{RG}(Z, Q) = 0`, because `Q` is a summand of a
free module `⊕ RG = Coind_H^G(⊕ RH)` and Shapiro's lemma gives `Ext¹_{RH}(Z, ⊕ RH) = 0`; the splice is
totally acyclic by `CochainComplex.isTotallyAcyclicProjective_splice`. *Needs:* Tau Ceti
`CochainComplex.isTotallyAcyclicProjective_splice`, `CategoryTheory.isGorensteinProjective`; Mathlib
`groupCohomology.coindIso`, `Rep.equivalenceModuleMonoidAlgebra`.

**Checks.**

- For `G` finite, `H = 1` and `R` a field, every `RG`-module is Gorenstein projective.
- For `H = G` the hypothesis is projectivity and the conclusion is `CategoryTheory.isGorensteinProjective_of_projective`.
- The hypothesis is used: for `G = ℤ` and `R ≠ 0`, the trivial module `R` has projective dimension
  `1`, and a Gorenstein-projective module of finite projective dimension is projective (it has no
  extensions by projectives, `CategoryTheory.isGorensteinProjective.ext_eq_zero`), which `R` is not.

### 9.2 Complete resolutions

Define a *complete resolution* of `R` over `RG` as a chain complex `F` indexed by `ℤ` that is a totally
acyclic complex of projectives (`CochainComplex.IsTotallyAcyclicProjective` after reindexing), with a
projective resolution `P → R` and a chain map `F → P` (`P` extended by zero in negative degrees) which
is an isomorphism in all degrees `≥ d` for some `d`. Prove that one exists with `d = n`, and that any
two are related by a homotopy equivalence commuting up to homotopy with their maps to `P`
(Farrell1977; BrownGTM87, §X.2). Route: the `n`-th syzygy `Ω` of `P` restricts to an `n`-th syzygy
over `RH`, projective as `cd_R H ≤ n` (2.1), so 9.1 gives a complete resolution of `Ω`, spliced with
`P` in degrees `≥ n`; for uniqueness, the syzygies of two resolutions agree up to projective summands
(Schanuel), hence are isomorphic in the stable category of the Frobenius exact structure on
Gorenstein-projective objects, and `TauCeti.ExactStructure.CompleteResolution.lift` with
`.nonempty_homotopy_zero_iff` and `.homotopyEquiv` give the homotopy equivalence. *Needs:* 9.1, 2.1;
Tau Ceti `CochainComplex.IsTotallyAcyclicProjective`,
`CategoryTheory.GorensteinProjective.exactStructure_isFrobenius`,
`TauCeti.ExactStructure.CompleteResolution.homotopyEquiv`,
`TauCeti.ExactStructure.CompleteResolution.nonempty_homotopy_zero_iff`.

- Restricting a complete resolution of `R` over `RG` to a finite-index subgroup gives one over that
  subgroup.
- A complete resolution agreeing with `P` above `d` agrees with it above every `d' ≥ d`.

**Checks.**

- For `G = ℤ/2 = ⟨s⟩` over `ℤ`, the periodic complex `⋯ → ℤG →(1 − s) ℤG →(1 + s) ℤG →(1 − s) ⋯`,
  agreeing with the periodic resolution in degrees `≥ 0`, is a complete resolution.
- If `cd_R G < ⊤`, the syzygy is projective and every complete resolution is contractible.
- For `G` trivial (`n = 0`), `F` is contractible: `R` is projective over `R`.

### 9.3 Farrell cohomology

Define `Ĥᵏ(G, M) = Hᵏ(Hom_{RG}(F, M))` for `k ∈ ℤ` and `M : Rep R G`, with the indexing of the
Conventions. Prove that it is independent of `F` up to canonical isomorphism (9.2), functorial in
`M`, has a natural long exact sequence for every short exact sequence of representations (each
`Hom_{RG}(F_k, −)` is exact), vanishes on projective `M` (total acyclicity), and has restriction maps
to finite-index subgroups compatible with the long exact sequences (Farrell1977; BrownGTM87, §X.3).
*Needs:* 9.2.

- `Ĥᵏ(G, −)` is an additive functor `Rep R G ⥤ ModuleCat R` for each `k ∈ ℤ`, and the connecting maps
  are natural.
- Dimension shifting: for `0 → M' → Q → M → 0` with `Q` projective, `Ĥᵏ(G, M) ≅ Ĥᵏ⁺¹(G, M')`.

**Checks.**

- For `G = ℤ/2` and `M = ℤ`: `Ĥ⁰ = ℤ/2`, `Ĥ⁻¹ = 0`, `Ĥ¹ = 0`, `Ĥ² = ℤ/2`; the indexing shifted by one
  degree gives `Ĥ⁰ = 0`.
- For `M = RG`, `Ĥ*(G, M) = 0`.
- For `G = ℤ`, `Ĥ*(G, −) = 0`.

### 9.4 Comparison with ordinary cohomology and vanishing

Prove: (a) the map `Hᵏ(G, M) → Ĥᵏ(G, M)` induced by `F → P` is an isomorphism for `k > n` and
surjective for `k = n`, naturally in `M` and compatibly with the long exact sequences (Farrell1977;
BrownGTM87, §X.3); (b) `Ĥ*(G, −) = 0` if and only if `cd_R G < ⊤`, and in particular Farrell cohomology
over `ℤ` vanishes for a torsion-free group of finite `vcd` (3.2). Route for (b): if `Ĥⁿ(G, Ω) = 0`,
the cocycle `P_n ↠ Ω` extends over `F_{n−1}`, so the identity of `Ω` factors through a projective and
`Ω` is projective. *Needs:* 9.2, 9.3, 2.1, 3.2.

**Checks.**

- For `G = ℤ/2 × ℤ` (`vcd = 1`) and `M = ℤ`, `Ĥᵏ(G, ℤ) = Hᵏ(G, ℤ) = ℤ/2` for `k ≥ 2`: `G` is the HNN
  extension of `ℤ/2` along the identity, and CohomologyOfGroups §3.6 gives
  `0 → Hᵏ⁻¹(ℤ/2, ℤ) → Hᵏ(G, ℤ) → Hᵏ(ℤ/2, ℤ) → 0`, with one outer term `ℤ/2` and the other `0`.
- For `ℤ/4 ∗_{ℤ/2} ℤ/6` (`vcd = 1`), `Ĥᵏ = Hᵏ(−, ℤ)` for `k ≥ 2`, which is `ℤ/12` for even and `0` for
  odd `k`: in even degrees the amalgam sequence of CohomologyOfGroups §3.6 reads
  `0 → Hᵏ → ℤ/4 ⊕ ℤ/6 → ℤ/2 → Hᵏ⁺¹ → 0`, restriction to `ℤ/2` being onto in even degrees, and the
  kernel contains `(1, 1)` of order `12`.
- At `k = n` the map is not injective in general: for `G = ℤ/2` (`n = 0`) it is `ℤ = H⁰ → Ĥ⁰ = ℤ/2`.

### 9.5 Finite groups

Prove that for `G` finite, Farrell cohomology over `R` is Mathlib's `tateCohomology`: natural
isomorphisms `Ĥᵏ(G, M) ≅ tateCohomology M k` for all `k ∈ ℤ`, compatible with the long exact
sequences and, for `k ≥ 1`, with the identification of both with `Hᵏ(G, M)` (BrownGTM87, §VI.3;
Farrell1977). Route: for `H = 1` and `n = 0`, splice the standard resolution with its `R`-dual along
the norm; `Hom_{RG}` of it into `M` is the norm splice of inhomogeneous cochains and chains defining
`tateCohomology`. *Needs:* 9.2–9.4; Mathlib `tateCohomology`, `TateCohomology.isoGroupCohomology`.

**Checks.**

- For `G = ℤ/2` and `M = ℤ` both sides are `ℤ/2, 0, ℤ/2, 0` in degrees `0, 1, 2, −1`.
- For `G = 1` both sides vanish.
- For `M = RG` both sides vanish.

### Examples

For a group of finite virtual cohomological dimension, Farrell cohomology captures the cohomology
above `vcd`, which comes from the finite subgroups: `ℤ/2 × ℤ` and `ℤ/4 ∗_{ℤ/2} ℤ/6` have the periodic
Farrell cohomology of their finite subgroups, and torsion-free groups have none.

## Downstream consumers

- MotivicStructuresInModuliOfCurves (TC.1, the virtual cohomological dimension of mapping class
  groups) consumes 4.1 (the definition and independence of `vcd`) and 4.3 (vanishing of rational
  cohomology above `vcd`).
- PosetHomotopyAndSubgroupComplexes, which leaves Brown's theorems on `χ` and the finite subgroups to
  a roadmap with `vcd` and `χ`, consumes Layers 4 and 8.
- ArithmeticKTheory §3.2 (Borel–Serre duality), the arithmetic roadmaps (`vcd` and `χ` of
  arithmetic groups), BianchiModularForms §9.3 and FuchsianOrbifolds (orbifold Euler
  characteristics) and MappingClassGroupsAndCanonicalRepresentations (mapping class groups) state
  instances: these arithmetic and mapping-class-group instances provide comparisons with the
  general invariants of Layers 4, 6 and 8.
