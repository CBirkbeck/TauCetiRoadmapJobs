# Polylogarithms, Part II: the weight-four Zagier theorem: target signatures

The roadmap is README.md; this file is not the roadmap. It states the roadmap's headline
theorems against the pinned APIs: the weight-four Zagier theorem of Goncharov and Rudenko for
every number field, as rational existence of explicit weight-four cycles and as rationality of
the zeta-normalized `L₄` determinant of every family of explicit weight-four cycles.

The explicit cycle condition is written on native carriers by testing the raw cobracket
`[x] ↦ [x]₃ ⊗ u(x)` against every function on the field that satisfies the explicit
weight-three presentation (Polylogarithms §§3.1–3.2 and §4.5); by the quotient universal
property this is membership in the kernel of that map into `B₃(F) ⊗ U(F)`. The analytic
functions are restated by the formulas of PolylogarithmFunctions.

The following headline theorems are not statable at the pins, and nothing is stated in their
place.

* The weight-four extension theorem `0 → B₄(F) → L₄(F) → Λ²B₂(F) → 0`, the cluster chain map
  and the descent of the weight-four cobracket: the pins have no carrier for the
  Goncharov–Rudenko group `L₄(F)`, the quotient of single and double symbols by the heptagon
  relation and its iterated one-parameter specializations, nor for the rational pre-Bloch group.
* The realization of the combinatorial Lie coalgebra by motivic correlators, base-point change,
  depth reduction and the period of every explicit cycle in the motivic Lie coalgebra: the pins
  have no mixed Tate motives over a number field, no motivic fundamental groupoid of a punctured
  line and no framed mixed Hodge–Tate structures.
* Collision continuity of Hodge correlators: the pins have no Hodge correlator integrals over
  plane trivalent trees.
* The Grassmannian configuration chain map and the generic polylogarithmic Chern cocycle: the pins
  have no configuration complexes of generic vectors, no Grassmannian group `G₄(F)` and no real
  Deligne cohomology of the simplicial classifying varieties.
* The maps `K_{8-i}(F)_ℚ → H^i Γ(F,4)` and the comparison of `L₄ ∘ κ` with the Borel regulator:
  the pins have no higher Quillen K-groups of a number field and no Borel regulator.

`∑ aₓ b(x) ⊗ u(x)` vanishes for every function `b` satisfying the explicit weight-three

one; for `r₂ = 0` the determinant is empty and the multiple is fixed (over `ℚ` it is `90`). -/
