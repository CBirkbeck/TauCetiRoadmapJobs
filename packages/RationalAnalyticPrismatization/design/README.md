# Roadmap: rational analytic prismatization

**Summary.** Build Gelfand analytic geometry over ℚ_p — bounded solid ℚ_p-algebras, Gelfand rings and their Berkovich spectra, Gelfand stacks, derived Berkovich spaces, analytic de Rham stacks, cones, deformation theory, Fargues–Fontaine curves and Hyodo–Kato stacks as Gelfand stacks — and on it the rational analytic prismatization of Anschütz–Le Bras–Rodríguez Camargo–Scholze: rational δ-spaces and analytic δ-stacks, the prismatization X^Δ of a Gelfand stack, its perfection, the p-adic twistor stack X^{Div¹} and the analytic Hodge–Tate stack X^HT, with the Breuil–Kisin twist, the prismatic logarithm and Faltings' extension. Independently, prove the decompletion theorem for Berkovich spaces with a continuous action of a p-adic Lie group and verify it in arithmetic, geometric and mixed Sen theory. The end theorems are: for a smooth partially proper rigid space X over a finite extension of ℚ_p, pullback along FF_{X^⋄} → X^{Div¹} is fully faithful and an equivalence on perfect complexes, also over every Berkovich-étale Y → X^{Div¹} (ALRS Theorem 6.3.1), with its perfectoid-base and arithmetic variants; Γ(X^{Div¹}, O) is pro-étale ℚ_p-cohomology; Hodge–Tate stacks recover v-perfect complexes with their arithmetic and geometric Sen operators and the inverse Faltings' extension; pro-étale torsors under p-adic Lie groups decomplete; Div¹ and twistor stacks of smooth maps satisfy Poincaré duality with the Breuil–Kisin twist; the prismatic first Chern class satisfies the projective bundle formula; and formal Hodge–Tate stacks recover Scholze's Riemann–Hilbert functor.

## Scope and ownership

This roadmap owns the Gelfand-stack foundations of ABLB §§2–6 that the prismatization uses (Layers 1–6), the theory of ALRS §§2–6 and Appendix A (Layers 4–12), and the decompletion theory of ALRS §5 for semilinear representations over Gelfand rings (Layer 10). No other roadmap defines Gelfand rings or stacks, derived Berkovich spaces, analytic de Rham or Hyodo–Kato stacks, rational δ-spaces, analytic δ-stacks, the analytic prismatization, the p-adic twistor stack, analytic Hodge–Tate stacks or decompletions over Gelfand rings. Layers 1–7 form a self-contained public interface for downstream consumers, such as a rational analytic syntomification or an integral analytic prismatization.

The following are imported, not rebuilt. Light profinite sets and light condensed sets are already in the library (Mathlib `LightProfinite`, `LightCondensed`); light solid abelian groups are SolidAnalyticRings §1.5. The Berkovich spectrum of a normed ring is TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §§0.1–0.24 and AdicSpacesPartIII §R3.9; this roadmap only identifies M(A) := M(A^u) with it. Rigid spaces, the rigid–adic comparison, partially proper and smooth morphisms and dagger spaces are RigidAnalyticGeometry §6.2, AdicSpacesPartII §§R0.4, R0.10, R0.16, R1.1 and AdicSpacesPartIV §F1; the Banach arc-site and Marc(A) are MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII §BM.0, of which this roadmap uses the light qfd hypersheaf version of ABLB with a comparison (2.8). Perfectoid rings, tilting, A_inf and Fontaine's θ are PerfectoidSpaces §§P1–P2 and P7.16; diamonds and the diamond of an analytic adic space are DiamondsAndVStacks §§D2, D4, D6. Relative Fargues–Fontaine curves, untilt divisors and Div¹ as v-sheaves are RelativeFarguesFontaine §§1.2, 2.1–2.2, 3.2, 4.7, FarguesFontaineDiamonds §§F2, F4 and VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §§VB−1, VB0, VB1, VB3, VB4; this roadmap realizes them as Gelfand stacks and proves the comparisons. Period sheaves, the classical Faltings' extension, Sen operators of C_p-representations and the functor associatedLocalSystem are PadicHodgeTheory §§2.2–2.3, 4.4, 7.1 with FiniteFlatGroupsAndIntegralPadicHodgeTheory §R07.P7.2; Tate's normalized traces are PadicPeriodRings §§1.3–1.4; the cyclotomic decompletion of Robba (φ, Γ)-modules is PhiGammaModulesAndIwasawaCohomology §1.4. The linear theory of locally analytic vectors is LocallyAnalyticRepresentationsOfLocalGroups §§LR.2–LR.3; p-valuations and Lazard coordinates are LocallyAnalyticDistributionsPartII §ND.0 and uniform groups NoncommutativeAndEquivariantIwasawa §§0.1, 0.6; this roadmap builds the light, semilinear version on Gelfand stacks and compares. The integral prismatic objects of PrismaticCohomology §1.5, PrismaticCohomologyPartII §§3.9, 4.12–4.13 and PrismaticCohomologyPartIII §6.10, the étale Chern classes and Poincaré duality of ClassicalAdicEtaleCohomology §9.3 and ClassicalAdicEtaleCohomologyPartII §5.9, and the Chern class comparison of CohomologyComparisons §6.7 are used only as Checks.

The general theory of analytic stacks — light analytic rings over ℚ_{p,■}, the ∞-topos of analytic stacks for !-equivalences, its quasi-coherent six-functor formalism and the Heyer–Mann extension theorem, suave, prim and cohomologically smooth or proper maps, Betti stacks, nuclear modules, the cotangent complex of analytic rings, Cartier duality for analytic vector bundles and algebraic stacks as analytic stacks — has no owner and is the subject of the required contracts below, assigned to a new roadmap AnalyticStacks; the interface that MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII calls AnalyticStacks AS.0 is part of the contract `analytic-stacks`. This roadmap does not plan that layer, because earlier roadmaps in the merge order need it too. ALRS also uses Scholze's Gestalten (Gest, Definitions 6.5 and 6.12) to enlarge the class of !-able maps; this roadmap does not: maps called 0-proper by ALRS are stated here as D-proper in the analytic-stack formalism, and !-ability of finitely presented maps is restricted to analytically locally l.c.i. maps, as ALRS Remark 2.1.1 permits.

Outside the scope: ℤ_p-coefficient analytic prismatization (ALRS Remark 1.27); filtered prismatization and syntomification (Hauck); characteristic-p geometry; the p-adic monodromy theorem (ABLB Theorem 7.1.1; PadicHodgeTheory §5.1); the Bhatt–Zhang Simpson gerbe and its Cartier duality (ALRS Remark 4.4.6); the identification of X^{Div¹} with FF^la_{X̃}/G^la (ALRS Remark 1.22, open); the comparison of Hyodo–Kato stacks with Colmez–Nizioł Hyodo–Kato cohomology (ABLB Remark 6.1.3); the bases W(k)[1/p] and relative prisms of ALRS footnotes 48 and 50; the geometrization of the locally analytic Langlands programme.

## Conventions

Fix a prime p and the absolute value with |p| = p^{-1}. Coefficients are ℚ_p throughout; this is the source's restriction (ALRS Remark 1.27). All rings are solid ℚ_p-algebras with the analytic ring structure induced from ℚ_{p,■}, everything is derived, and Γ, f_*, f_!, ⊗ are derived functors. "Anima" means spaces in the sense of EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E0.5. Gelfand rings, Gelfand stacks and arc-stacks are separable and light; from Layer 3 onwards they are also qfd, as in ALRS from §2.4 onwards.

Six functors are those of 2.2. Suave, prim, D-smooth (cohomologically smooth), D-proper (cohomologically proper) and D-étale are HM Definitions 4.5.1 and 4.6.1. Where ALRS calls a map 0-proper, the corresponding target states that it is D-proper, which gives f_! ≅ f_* by HM Lemma 4.6.4(ii); the dualizing complex of a D-smooth map f is ω_f = f^!O. "Cartier divisor" means generalized Cartier divisor (L, s: L → O), L a line bundle (3.6). The universal divisor on A¹/G_m has ideal sheaf I of G_m-weight −1, and cones carry the twist (−1) of Lemma 2.8.6: on the special fibre the tangent direction has weight −1.

For a p-adic Lie group G, G^cont, G^la and G^sm are the group Gelfand stacks of continuous, locally analytic and locally constant ℚ_p-valued functions, with maps G^cont → G^la → G^sm (3.4, 10.3). X^{Div¹~} denotes the perfect prismatization lim_φ X^Δ and Div¹~ = (Q_p^Δ)^{Div¹~}, written with a tilde over Div¹ in ALRS.

Radius. For a perfectoid S of characteristic p with pseudo-uniformizer ϖ, κ_ϖ(x) = log|[ϖ]|_x / log|p|_x on D_{FF,S}; Frobenius multiplies κ by p and κ^{-1}(0) = {|p| = 0}. Witness: at the untilt C of C♭ with ϖ = p♭, κ = 1, and the n-th Frobenius translate has radius p^n. On X^Δ the radius is reciprocal: the Hodge–Tate locus lies at 1 and its n-th inverse Frobenius translate at p^{-n} (6.1, 8.5).

Twists. O(λ) on a Fargues–Fontaine curve descends O ⊗ D_{−λ}, D_λ the standard isocrystal of slope λ, so O(1) has nonzero sections: Γ(FF_{C♭}, O(1)) = BC(O(1))(C) = 1 + 𝔪_{C♭}, while Γ(FF_{C♭}, O(−1)) = 0. On Hyodo–Kato stacks O(n) is the isocrystal (ℚ_p, p^{-n}φ); O⟨1⟩ is the line bundle of (ℚ_p, p^{-1}φ), and the dualizing complex of Div^{1,dR} and the Hyodo–Kato Tate twist is O⟨1⟩[2] (ABLB writes O⟨1⟩ for O(1)[2]). Witness: H¹ of G_m in Hyodo–Kato cohomology is O(−1) = (ℚ_p, pφ), Frobenius acting on dlog T by p. The Tate twist ℚ_p(d) on a relative Fargues–Fontaine curve is the slope-zero line bundle of the cyclotomic character, not O(d). The Breuil–Kisin twist is O{1} = I_BK ⊗ O⟨1⟩; on Div¹ it is I_{Div¹} ⊗ O⟨1⟩, pulling back to the Tate twist on FF_{Q_p^⋄} and to Ĉ(1) on Q_p^HT. Witness on the cyclotomic prism: e = (log q/(q − 1)) ⊗ e⟨1⟩ satisfies φ(e) = [p]_q^{-1}e, and log_Δ(q) = (q − 1)e (9.8, 9.9).

Sen operators and actions. The arithmetic Sen operator of O{n} on X^HT is multiplication by n (ALRS Example 6.1.4), so Tate's computation reads H^i(Gal_K, C_p(n)) = H^i(K →^{n} K). An element a ∈ ℤ_p^× acts on the cyclotomic δ-space by q^{1/p^m} ↦ q^{a/p^m}, and p ∈ ℚ_p^× acts by Frobenius q ↦ q^p. Faltings' extension is 0 → O{1} → FE_X → Ω¹_X ⊗ O → 0, with O{1} = Ô(1) on X̂^⋄.

Universes and cardinals: Gelfand rings range over an essentially small model of κ-compact separable Gelfand rings for a fixed uncountable regular cardinal κ (ABLB footnote 27), and arc-stacks over separable perfectoid spaces; every construction is made for this fixed κ.

### Required contracts with missing owners

Every contract below is a recorded prerequisite gap, consumed only through the corresponding `gap:` key in the data plan; none is planned in this roadmap. The contracts with supplier "none" belong to a new roadmap AnalyticStacks, which must precede MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII in the merge order since that roadmap requests the same interface.

## How to read the build

Layer 1 builds Gelfand rings from bounded solid ℚ_p-algebras and identifies their Berkovich spectra with those of the supplier Banach-ring theory; Layer 2 glues them into Gelfand stacks, proves that perfect complexes are dualizable and descend, that nilperfectoid rings form a basis, and embeds derived Berkovich and rigid spaces; Layer 3 adds the analytic de Rham stack, analytification and Cartier divisors. Layer 4 fixes the morphism classes, pushouts and deformation theory used later, and Layer 5 the cone construction and the filtered de Rham stack. Layer 6 realizes Fargues–Fontaine discs, curves and Hyodo–Kato stacks as Gelfand stacks. Layers 7–9 are the core of the prismatization: δ-spaces and δ-stacks, the prismatization with its twistor and Hodge–Tate stacks, and their explicit geometry (Hodge–Tate gerbes, Faltings' extension, ℚ_p, the Breuil–Kisin twist, the prismatic logarithm). Layer 10 is the decompletion theory of ALRS §5, which depends only on Layers 1–7. Layer 11 combines Layers 9 and 10 into the comparison theorems, with the headline 11.6, and Layer 12 derives duality, Chern classes and the relation to the Riemann–Hilbert functor. Each subsection states its target with hypotheses and locators; a proof route names one route and its inputs without making it mandatory, and the *Needs:* line lists what the statement and that route use.

## Layer 1: Bounded solid ℚ_p-algebras and Gelfand rings

This layer builds the affine building blocks of Gelfand analytic geometry from light solid ℚ_p-algebras: the bounded condition, the norm filtration and the †-nilradical, the uniform completion, Gelfand rings with their Berkovich spectra and †-rational localizations, the Fredholm property, and the classes of totally disconnected, strictly totally disconnected and nilperfectoid rings. Every construction here is a property of, or a functor on, solid ℚ_p-algebras with the induced analytic ring structure; the analytic ring itself is the supplier contract `analytic-stacks`.

### 1.1 Bounded solid ℚ_p-algebras

For an animated commutative algebra A over the light solid analytic ring ℚ_{p,■}, define the power-bounded subring A° by its values on light profinite sets S, A°(S) = Map(ℤ_{p,■}⟨ℕ[S]⟩, A), where ℤ_{p,■}⟨ℕ[S]⟩ is the p-adic completion of the free solid ℤ_p-algebra on S, and the bounded subring A^b = A°[1/p]. Call A bounded when A^b → A is an equivalence. Prove that A ↦ A^b is right adjoint to the inclusion of bounded algebras into solid ℚ_p-algebras, so that bounded algebras are closed under all colimits computed in solid ℚ_p-algebras (ABLB Definition 2.1.1, p. 12, ABLB line 609; ABLB Lemma 2.1.2, p. 12, ABLB line 622). Boundedness is a property and not extra structure, because ℤ_{p,■}⟨ℕ[S]⟩ is idempotent over ℤ_{p,■}[ℕ[S]].

A proof route: Use the idempotency of ℤ_{p,■}⟨ℕ[S]⟩ over ℤ_{p,■}[ℕ[S]] to see that A° is a subobject, so that (−)^b is idempotent; the adjunction is then formal, and colimits of bounded algebras are bounded because (−)^b is a right adjoint fixing them.

*Needs:* required contract `analytic-stacks`; Mathlib `LightProfinite`; SolidAnalyticRings §1.5.

The API has the following laws.

- For bounded A and every light profinite S and map f: S → A there is n ≥ 0 such that p^n·f extends to an algebra map ℤ_{p,■}⟨ℕ[S]⟩ → A; conversely this condition for all S implies boundedness.
- Maps from a bounded algebra B to a solid ℚ_p-algebra A factor uniquely through A^b → A; A^b is bounded and (A^b)^b = A^b.
- Colimits of bounded algebras computed in solid ℚ_p-algebras are bounded; in particular pushouts and filtered colimits are.
- Every algebra map A → B sends A° into B° and A^b into B^b.

**Checks.**

- For A = ℚ_p the point values are A°(*) = ℤ_p and A^b(*) = ℚ_p, so ℚ_p is bounded; replacing ℤ_{p,■}⟨ℕ[S]⟩ by the uncompleted free algebra would make every element power-bounded.
- For the discrete polynomial algebra A = ℚ_p[T] with induced structure, no p^n·T extends to ℤ_p⟨T⟩ → ℚ_p[T], since the image of Σ_k p^k T^k would be a non-terminating sum in ⊕_k ℚ_p T^k; hence A^b = ℚ_p and A is not bounded.
- The Tate algebra ℚ_p⟨T⟩ is bounded with T ∈ ℚ_p⟨T⟩°(*) = ℤ_p⟨T⟩.
- The zero ring is bounded, with A° = A^b = 0.

### 1.2 The norm filtration, the †-nilradical and †-reduction

For r ∈ ℝ_{≥0} and a light profinite set S, let ℚ_{p,■}⟨ℕ[S]⟩_{≤r} be the solid subring of ℚ_{p,■}⟦ℕ[S]⟧ of power series converging on the polydisc of radius r (ABLB Definition 2.2.3, p. 13, ABLB line 686). For a solid ℚ_p-algebra A define A_{≤r}(S) = Map(ℚ_{p,■}⟨ℕ[S]⟩_{≤r}, A), A_{<r} = ⋃_{r′<r} A_{≤r′} and the †-nilradical Nil†(A) = A_{≤0} (ABLB Definition 2.2.8, p. 14, ABLB line 746). Then A_{≤1} is a solid animated ℤ_p-algebra, each A_{≤r} is a solid A_{≤1}-module, and A = ⋃_r A_{≤r} when A is bounded (ALRS §2.1, p. 13, ALRS line 640). Define the †-reduction A^{†-red} = A/Nil†(A), a static solid ℚ_p-algebra (ABLB Definition 2.2.19, p. 19, ABLB line 974). Prove that A_{≤1} → A^{†-red}_{≤1} over A → A^{†-red} is a pullback square, similarly for A_{≤r} and A_{<1}, and that Nil†(A^{†-red}) = 0 (ABLB Proposition 2.2.20, p. 19, ABLB line 981).

A proof route: The objects are subobjects by the idempotency of ℚ_{p,■}⟨ℕ[S]⟩_{≤r} over ℚ_{p,■}[ℕ[S]] (ABLB Lemma 2.2.5); the pullback square follows from the description of A_{<r} by null sequences (ABLB Corollary 2.2.14).

*Needs:* §1.1; required contract `analytic-stacks`.

The API has the following laws.

- For r ≤ s one has A_{≤r} ⊆ A_{≤s}, and A_{≤r}·A_{≤s} ⊆ A_{≤rs}; multiplication by p maps A_{≤r} into A_{≤r/p}, matching |p| = p^{-1}.
- Nil†(A) is an ideal of A contained in A_{<r} for every r > 0, and every nilpotent element of A(*) lies in Nil†(A).
- Every algebra map from A to a †-reduced bounded algebra factors uniquely through A → A^{†-red}.
- An algebra map A → B sends A_{≤r} into B_{≤r} for every r.

**Checks.**

- For A = ℚ_p⟨T⟩ one has A_{≤1} = ℤ_p⟨T⟩, A_{≤p^{-k}} = p^k ℤ_p⟨T⟩ and Nil†(A) = 0.
- For A = ℚ_p[ε]/ε² the element ε lies in A_{≤r} for all r, so Nil†(A) = ℚ_p·ε and A^{†-red} = ℚ_p.
- For A = colim_n ℚ_p⟨T/p^n⟩, the functions on the overconvergent neighbourhood of 0, the element T lies in A_{≤p^{-n}} for all n, hence in Nil†(A), although T is not nilpotent; the †-nilradical is not the nilradical.
- For A = ℤ_p⟦T⟧[1/p] the element T is topologically nilpotent but lies in no A_{≤r} with r < 1 (ABLB Remark 2.2.9(2)), so A_{<1} is strictly smaller than the topologically nilpotent elements.

### 1.3 Uniform completion

For a bounded solid ℚ_p-algebra A define its uniform completion A^u = (lim_r A_{≤1}/A_{≤r})[1/p] = (A_{≤1})^∧_p[1/p], with the analytic ring structure induced from A (ABLB Definition 2.3.1, p. 20, ABLB line 1037). Prove: A^u is bounded and static; A_{≤1} → A^u_{≤1} over A → A^u is a pullback square (and likewise for A_{≤r}, A_{<1}); the map A^{†-red} → A^u is injective and (A^{†-red})^u = A^u; (A^u)^u = A^u and Nil†(A^u) = 0; an element f ∈ A is invertible if and only if its image in A^u is (ABLB Proposition 2.3.6, p. 21, ABLB line 1080). The inclusion of uniform bounded algebras has left adjoint A ↦ A^u, which commutes with colimits (ABLB Corollary 2.3.7, p. 22, ABLB line 1143).

A proof route: Boundedness of A^u holds because it is the generic fibre of a p-adically complete solid ring (RC24 Lemma 2.6.13); the pullback square is proved on null sequences as in 1.2; the unit criterion follows from the pullback square and the invertibility of 1 + x for x ∈ A_{<1}.

*Needs:* AdicSpacesPartIV §F1.2; AdicSpacesPartIV §F1.1; §1.2; required contract `analytic-stacks`; AdicSpacesPartII §R0.4.

The API has the following laws.

- Every map from A to a uniform bounded algebra B factors uniquely through A → A^u.
- A^u depends only on A^{†-red}: the map A → A^u factors through A^{†-red} and induces (A^{†-red})^u ≅ A^u.
- f ∈ A(*) is a unit if and only if its image in A^u(*) is a unit.
- For a Banach ℚ_p-algebra B with induced structure, B^u is the uniformization of B in the sense of AdicSpacesPartII §R0.4 (the completion for the spectral seminorm).

**Checks.**

- ℚ_p⟨T⟩^u = ℚ_p⟨T⟩, since ℤ_p⟨T⟩ is p-adically complete and A_{≤0} = 0.
- For A = ℚ_p[ε]/ε², A^u = ℚ_p; the unit 1 + ε maps to the unit 1 and the non-unit ε maps to 0, as the unit criterion requires.
- For the overconvergent algebra A = ℚ_p⟨T⟩_{≤1} = colim_{r>1} ℚ_p⟨T/r⟩ one has Nil†(A) = 0 and A^u = ℚ_p⟨T⟩, so A^{†-red} → A^u is injective but not surjective; A is †-reduced and not uniform.
- The zero ring has zero uniform completion, and A^u = 0 forces A = 0 by the unit criterion applied to 0.

### 1.4 Gelfand rings, separable and quasi-finite-dimensional

Call a bounded solid ℚ_p-algebra A a Gelfand ring if A/A_{≤1} is a discrete condensed set (ABLB Definition 3.1.1, p. 23, ABLB line 1162). Prove that A is Gelfand if and only if A^u is a Banach ℚ_p-algebra, and that Gelfand rings are closed under colimits in bounded algebras (ABLB Proposition 3.1.4, p. 23, ABLB line 1176). Call A separable if A^u is a separable Banach algebra (ABLB Definition 4.2.6(1), p. 42, ABLB line 2190) and quasi-finite-dimensional (qfd) if moreover A^u is qfd, that is, Marc(A^u) → Marc(ℚ_p) is quasi-pro-étale over a relative affine space (ABLB Definition 4.1.11, p. 39, ABLB line 2061; ABLB Definition 4.2.14(1), p. 43, ABLB line 2261).

A proof route: A/A_{≤1} = A^u/A^u_{≤1} by 1.3, so the condition depends only on A^u; A^u is Banach if and only if A_{≤1}/A_{≤1/p} is discrete, and discreteness is stable under filtered colimits, subobjects, quotients and extensions (ABLB Remark 3.1.2).

*Needs:* §1.3; MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII §BM.0; required contract `analytic-stacks`.

The API has the following laws.

- A is Gelfand if and only if A^{†-red} is Gelfand if and only if A^u is a Banach ℚ_p-algebra.
- Pushouts, finite products and filtered colimits of Gelfand rings computed in bounded algebras are Gelfand; separable Gelfand rings are closed under pushouts and finite products.
- Every Banach ℚ_p-algebra B with its induced analytic ring structure is a Gelfand ring; Nil†(B) consists of the elements of spectral seminorm zero, so B is †-reduced exactly when its spectral seminorm is a norm.
- The qfd condition is stable under pushouts along maps of qfd separable Gelfand rings and under finite products.

**Checks.**

- ℚ_p⟨T_1,…,T_n⟩, its overconvergent version ℚ_p⟨T_1,…,T_n⟩_{≤1}, ℚ_p[ε]/ε² and the completed algebraic closure C_p are separable qfd Gelfand rings.
- For an infinite light profinite set S, A = ℚ_{p,■}⟨ℕ[S]⟩_{≤1} is bounded but not Gelfand: A_{≤1}/A_{≤1/p} contains 𝔽_{p,■}[S] as a direct summand, which is not discrete (ABLB Example 3.1.3).
- The separable Gelfand ring ℚ_p⟨T_n : n ∈ ℕ⟩ is not qfd: its spectrum contains the Hilbert cube [0,1]^ℕ through the Gauss points of prescribed radii |T_n| = r_n, so it has infinite covering dimension, whereas a qfd ring is quasi-pro-étale over a finite-dimensional polydisc and its spectrum has finite covering dimension.
- The zero ring is a separable qfd Gelfand ring.

### 1.5 The Berkovich spectrum and residue fields

For a Banach ℚ_p-algebra B let M(B) be the set of continuous multiplicative seminorms |·| on B with |p| = p^{-1}, with the topology of pointwise convergence; for a Gelfand ring A put M(A) := M(A^u) (ABLB Definition 3.1.5, p. 23, ABLB line 1189). For f_1,…,f_n, g ∈ A generating the unit ideal define the rational subspace M(A)(f/g) = {|f_i| ≤ |g| ≠ 0}, a closed subset. For x ∈ M(A) define the stalk A_x as the colimit of the rational localizations containing x and the Berkovich residue field κ(x) = (A_x)^u, the completed residue field of A^u at x (ABLB Definition 3.1.15, p. 26, ABLB line 1335). Prove that M(A) is compact Hausdorff, metrizable when A is separable (ABLB Remark 3.1.6), nonempty when A ≠ 0, functorial (ABLB Lemma 3.1.8) and that M(colim A_i) = lim M(A_i) for filtered colimits (ABLB Lemma 3.1.12). Prove that M(A) is the Berkovich spectrum `Spectrum` of TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.1 and the Gel'fand spectrum `Huber.GelfandSpectrum` of AdicSpacesPartIII §R3.9 of the Banach ring A^u with its gauge norm.

A proof route: Compactness, Hausdorffness and nonemptiness are imported from TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.7, §0.8 and §0.13 applied to A^u. The normalization |p| = p^{-1} is automatic for a bounded seminorm on a ℚ_p-algebra, because a bounded multiplicative seminorm on ℚ_p is the p-adic absolute value (§0.11); a seminorm bounded by C·‖·‖ is bounded by ‖·‖ by multiplicativity, so the two notions of point agree.

*Needs:* TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.8; TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.7; Mathlib `MulRingSeminorm`; §1.4; TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.1; TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.11; TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.13; TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.15; AdicSpacesPartIII §R3.9.

The API has the following laws.

- A map A → B of Gelfand rings induces a continuous map M(B) → M(A), functorially.
- M(A) = ∅ if and only if A = 0.
- For a filtered colimit A = colim A_i of Gelfand rings, M(A) → lim M(A_i) is a homeomorphism.
- M(A) equals TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic `Spectrum` and AdicSpacesPartIII `Huber.GelfandSpectrum` of A^u, compatibly with evaluation and with induced maps.
- κ(x) is a complete nonarchimedean field extension of ℚ_p, equal to the completed residue field of A^u at x (TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.15).

**Checks.**

- M(ℚ_p) is a point and M(ℚ_p × ℚ_p) is two points; M(0) = ∅.
- M(ℚ_p⟨T⟩) contains the Gauss point with |T| = 1 and the rigid point T = 0 with |T| = 0; the Gauss point is not a maximal ideal, so M is not the maximal spectrum.
- M(ℚ_p[ε]/ε²) = M(ℚ_p) and M(ℚ_p⟨T⟩_{≤1}) = M(ℚ_p⟨T⟩): the spectrum sees only the uniform completion.
- The trivial absolute value on ℚ_p is not a point, since points satisfy |p| = p^{-1}.

### 1.6 †-rational localizations and Berkovich-étale maps

For a Gelfand ring A and f_1,…,f_n, g ∈ A(*) generating the unit ideal define the †-rational localization A⟨f/g⟩_{≤1} = A⟨T_1,…,T_n⟩_{≤1}/L(gT_i − f_i), where A⟨T⟩_{≤1} = A ⊗_{ℚ_p} ℚ_p⟨T⟩_{≤1} and L denotes the derived quotient, and the Tate-rational localization A⟨f/g⟩ = A⟨T⟩/L(gT_i − f_i) with A⟨T⟩ = A ⊗_{ℚ_p} ℚ_p⟨T⟩ (ALRS Notations and conventions, p. 11, ALRS line 590). Prove that A → A⟨f/g⟩_{≤1} is an idempotent morphism of Gelfand rings, that a map A → B factors through it if and only if M(B) → M(A) lands in M(A)(f/g), and that M(A⟨f/g⟩_{≤1}) → M(A) is a homeomorphism onto M(A)(f/g) identifying rational subspaces (ABLB Proposition 3.1.9, p. 24, ABLB line 1260). Define Berkovich-étale maps of Gelfand rings as maps which locally for strict closed covers are composites of †-rational localizations and finite étale maps (ABLB Definition 3.2.8, p. 32, ABLB line 1658), and prove that Berkovich-étale maps of A, A^{†-red} and A^u correspond (ABLB Proposition 3.2.11, p. 33, ABLB line 1712).

A proof route: The element g is invertible in the localization because Σ a_i f_i + b g = 1 gives 1 = g(Σ a_i T_i + b); idempotency reduces to the idempotency of ℚ_p⟨T⟩_{≤1} over ℚ_p[T]; the topological statement is checked on uniform completions.

*Needs:* §1.5; §1.3; required contract `analytic-stacks`.

The API has the following laws.

- A⟨f/g⟩_{≤1} ⊗_A A⟨f/g⟩_{≤1} ≅ A⟨f/g⟩_{≤1}.
- A map A → B factors (uniquely) through A⟨f/g⟩_{≤1} if and only if the image of M(B) → M(A) lies in M(A)(f/g).
- M(A⟨f/g⟩_{≤1}) → M(A) is a homeomorphism onto the closed subset M(A)(f/g).
- Base change along A → A^u induces an equivalence between Berkovich-étale A-algebras and Berkovich-étale A^u-algebras.

**Checks.**

- For A = ℚ_p⟨T⟩, the †-rational localization at {|T| ≤ 1} is A itself, because T already lies in A_{≤1}.
- For A = ℚ_p⟨T⟩ and the locus {|T| ≤ |p|}, the localization is colim_{r>1/p} ℚ_p⟨T/r⟩, whose spectrum is the closed disc of radius p^{-1}, a closed and not open subset.
- For f = 1, g = p·1 on A = ℚ_p the locus {|1| ≤ |p|} is empty and the localization is the zero ring.
- For A = ℚ_p⟨T⟩ and the locus {|T| ≤ |p|} the Tate-rational localization is ℚ_p⟨T/p⟩, which differs from the †-rational one; both have the same spectrum.

### 1.7 Gelfand rings are Fredholm

Prove that every Gelfand ring A is Fredholm: every dualizable object of D(A) is discrete, that is, it lies in the image of the fully faithful embedding of perfect complexes over the abstract ring A(*) (ABLB Definition 3.3.1, p. 33, ABLB line 1724; ABLB Proposition 3.3.5, p. 35, ABLB line 1828). More generally, a bounded affinoid ℚ_p-algebra whose uniform completion is Fredholm is Fredholm.

A proof route: Follow ABLB §3.3: by the Fredholm criterion of the analytic-stack contract (Sch24 Proposition VI.1.5) it suffices to show that a compact connective complex K with K ⊗_A A^u perfect is perfect; reduce along the square-zero filtration of A → A^u (ABLB Lemmas 3.3.2–3.3.3), using that Banach ℚ_p-algebras are Fredholm (Sch24 Proposition VI.1.7).

*Needs:* §1.3; §1.4; required contract `analytic-stacks-betti-nuclear`.

**Checks.**

- Over A = ℚ_p the dualizable objects are the bounded complexes of finite-dimensional ℚ_p-vector spaces.
- Over A = ℚ_p × ℚ_p a dualizable object is a pair of finite-dimensional complexes; its ranks at the two points of M(A) may differ, so Fredholm does not force constant rank.
- The solid ℚ_p-vector space ℚ_p⟨T⟩ is not dualizable over ℚ_p, consistent with the Fredholm property since it is not a perfect ℚ_p-complex.

### 1.8 Totally disconnected, strictly totally disconnected and nilperfectoid rings

Call a Gelfand ring A totally disconnected if M(A) is profinite, strictly totally disconnected if moreover every Berkovich residue field κ(x) is algebraically closed, nilperfectoid if A^{†-red} → A^u is an isomorphism and A^u is perfectoid, and uniformly perfectoid if A^u is perfectoid (ALRS Definition 2.1.5, p. 15, ALRS line 785; ALRS Proposition 3.4.7, p. 48, ALRS line 2501). Prove that a strictly totally disconnected Gelfand ring with A^{†-red} = A^u is nilperfectoid (ALRS Remark 2.1.6, p. 15, ALRS line 793), via the statement that a Gelfand ring with profinite spectrum and perfectoid residue fields has perfectoid uniform completion (ABLB Lemma 3.1.17, p. 27, ABLB line 1428).

A proof route: For the remark, residue fields of a strictly totally disconnected ring are complete algebraically closed, hence perfectoid fields (PerfectoidSpaces §P1.10); ABLB Lemma 3.1.17 propagates perfectoidness from the residue fields over the profinite spectrum using a locally defined pseudo-uniformizer π with π^p | p.

*Needs:* Mathlib `PadicComplex`; §1.5; PerfectoidSpaces §P1.1; PerfectoidSpaces §P1.10; MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII §BM.0.

The API has the following laws.

- A is nilperfectoid if and only if Nil†(A) → A → A^u is a fibre sequence and A^u is a perfectoid Banach ℚ_p-algebra.
- Nilperfectoid rings are uniformly perfectoid; perfectoid Banach ℚ_p-algebras are nilperfectoid.
- Among Banach ℚ_p-algebras, the strictly totally disconnected Banach rings of MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII §BM.0 (strict-basis) are exactly the uniform strictly totally disconnected Gelfand rings.

**Checks.**

- C_p and C(S, C_p) for a light profinite S are nilperfectoid; the latter is strictly totally disconnected with M = S.
- C_p[ε]/ε² is nilperfectoid: its †-reduction C_p equals its uniform completion.
- The uncompleted cyclotomic field ℚ_p(μ_{p^∞}) is uniformly perfectoid but not nilperfectoid, because its †-reduction is itself and differs from its completion.
- ℚ_p is totally disconnected (M is a point) but not nilperfectoid, since ℚ_p is not perfectoid.

### Examples

The Tate algebra ℚ_p⟨T⟩ is a uniform qfd Gelfand ring with M(ℚ_p⟨T⟩) the Berkovich closed unit disc. The overconvergent algebra ℚ_p⟨T⟩_{≤1} = colim_{r>1} ℚ_p⟨T/r⟩ is †-reduced, not uniform, with uniform completion ℚ_p⟨T⟩. The ring C_p[ε]/ε² is nilperfectoid with †-nilradical C_p·ε. The uncompleted cyclotomic field ℚ_p(μ_{p^∞}) is uniformly perfectoid and not nilperfectoid.

### Dependencies

The light solid ℚ_p analytic ring and induced structures (required contract `analytic-stacks`); TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.1, §0.11, §0.13, §0.15, §0.7, §0.8; AdicSpacesPartIII §R3.9; AdicSpacesPartII §R0.4; AdicSpacesPartIV §F1.1–§F1.2; PerfectoidSpaces §P1.1, §P1.10; MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII §BM.0; EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E5:descent.

## Layer 2: Gelfand stacks, perfect complexes and derived Berkovich spaces

This layer defines Gelfand stacks as analytic stacks on separable Gelfand rings, restricts the quasi-coherent six-functor formalism to them, proves that perfect complexes are the dualizable objects and satisfy !-descent, proves that nilperfectoid rings form a basis of the !-topology, and embeds derived Berkovich spaces, †-rigid spaces and partially proper rigid spaces. It ends with light arc-stacks and the perfectoidization functor, which is the bridge to perfectoid geometry.

### 2.1 Gelfand stacks

Let GelfRing_{ω₁} be (an essentially small model of) the category of separable Gelfand rings, stable under pushouts and finite products. Define the ∞-category of Gelfand stacks GelfStk = AnStk(GelfRing_{ω₁}^op), the full subcategory of presheaves of anima on affinoid Gelfand stacks GSpec(A) which invert countably presented !-equivalences, where a map is a !-equivalence when every base change of every iterated diagonal induces an equivalence on !-categories D^! (ABLB Definition 4.2.1, p. 40, ABLB line 2109; ABLB Definition 4.2.6, p. 42, ABLB line 2189). Define qfd Gelfand stacks GelfStk^qfd likewise on separable qfd Gelfand rings (ABLB Definition 4.2.14, p. 43, ABLB line 2261). Construct the morphisms of ∞-topoi AnStk → GelfStk → GelfStk^qfd, whose left adjoints preserve finite limits and colimits; the right adjoint of the first, the Gelfandification (−)^Gelf, sends an analytic stack X to A ↦ X(AnSpec(A)) (ABLB Lemma 4.2.7, p. 42, ABLB line 2198; ALRS §2.1, p. 13, ALRS line 662). From §2.4 of ALRS onwards, and from Layer 3 of this roadmap onwards, every Gelfand ring, Gelfand stack and arc-stack is separable and qfd.

A proof route: The inclusion of separable Gelfand rings into analytic rings over ℚ_{p,■} preserves pushouts and !-equivalences (ABLB Lemma 4.2.7), so the analytic-stack construction of the contract restricts; descendable maps are !-covers by the contract and EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E5:descent.

*Needs:* EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E0.5; §1.4; §1.6; required contract `analytic-stacks`; EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E2.7; EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E5:descent.

The API has the following laws.

- A separable Gelfand ring A defines the representable Gelfand stack GSpec(A), and A ↦ GSpec(A) is fully faithful on separable Gelfand rings (the site is subcanonical).
- A descendable map A → B of separable Gelfand rings induces an epimorphism GSpec(B) → GSpec(A) of Gelfand stacks.
- The functor (−)^An: GelfStk → AnStk is left exact and colimit-preserving with right adjoint (−)^Gelf, and (−)^An is fully faithful on affinoid Gelfand stacks.
- GelfStk and GelfStk^qfd are ∞-topoi, and the restriction GelfStk → GelfStk^qfd is the inverse image of a geometric morphism.

**Checks.**

- GSpec(ℚ_p) is the final Gelfand stack and GSpec(0) is the initial one; any sheaf takes value a point on GSpec(0).
- GSpec(A × B) = GSpec(A) ⊔ GSpec(B) for separable Gelfand rings A, B, because D(A × B) = D(A) × D(B).
- The !-cover ℚ_p → ℤ_p((x))^∧_p[1/p] of analytic rings is not refined by a !-cover from Gelfand rings, which is why (−)^An is not claimed fully faithful on all Gelfand stacks (ABLB footnote 28).

### 2.2 The quasi-coherent six-functor formalism on Gelfand stacks

Pull back the quasi-coherent six-functor formalism D(−) of analytic stacks over AnSpec(ℚ_{p,■}) along (−)^An to a six-functor formalism on Gelfand stacks (ABLB Remark 4.2.8, p. 42, ABLB line 2209). Its class of !-able maps contains every map of affinoid Gelfand stacks, with f_! = f_*, every map of Betti stacks coming from a ℚ-fine map of condensed anima, every map of derived Berkovich spaces with finite-dimensional underlying space, and the de Rham stacks of arc-locally lqfd maps of qfd arc-stacks (ALRS Remark 2.1.3, p. 15, ALRS line 751). Define suave, prim, cohomologically smooth (D-smooth), cohomologically proper (D-proper) and cohomologically étale maps by HM Definitions 4.5.1 and 4.6.1 for this formalism. This roadmap does not use the extension of the !-able class by Gestalten (ALRS Construction 2.1.2); where ALRS calls a map 0-proper, the corresponding target here states that the map is D-proper, which gives f_! ≅ f_* (HM Lemma 4.6.4, p. 75, HM line 3783), as ALRS Remark 2.1.1 permits.

*Needs:* §2.1; required contract `analytic-stacks`.

The API has the following laws.

- For a map f: GSpec(B) → GSpec(A) of affinoid Gelfand stacks, f is D-proper and f_! ≅ f_* is the forgetful functor D(B) → D(A).
- For a cartesian square of Gelfand stacks with f !-able, g^* f_! ≅ f′_! g′^*, and the projection formula f_!(M ⊗ f^*N) ≅ f_!M ⊗ N holds.
- D-properness and D-smoothness of a truncated map are local on the target for !-covers, and D-properness can be checked on a universal D-proper !-cover of the source (HM Lemma 4.6.3).
- If the diagonal of f is D-proper, then f is D-proper if and only if the natural map f_! → f_* is an equivalence (HM Lemma 4.6.4(ii)).

**Checks.**

- GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩) → GSpec(ℚ_p) is D-proper, with f_! = f_* the forgetful functor; its global sections of O are ℚ_p⟨T⟩.
- The open unit disc over ℚ_p is cohomologically smooth with dualizing complex Ω¹[1] and is not D-proper, while the closed disc GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩) is D-proper and is neither Berkovich-smooth nor rigid smooth (ALRS Warning 2.6.13): properness and smoothness separate the two discs.
- The identity of any Gelfand stack is D-proper, D-smooth and D-étale with trivial dualizing and codualizing complexes.

### 2.3 Perfect complexes, eventually connective and nuclear modules satisfy descent

Prove that for integers a ≤ b the prestack of categories A ↦ Perf^{[a,b]}(A) of perfect A-modules of amplitude [a,b] extends uniquely to a sheaf of categories Perf^{[a,b]}(−) on GelfStk, inverting !-equivalences (ABLB Lemma 4.2.11, p. 43, ABLB line 2235), and that for every Gelfand stack X the category Perf(X) ⊂ D(X) is exactly the full subcategory of dualizable objects (ALRS §2.1, p. 16, ALRS line 809). Prove that locally eventually connective modules D^+(−) and nuclear modules Nuc(D(−)) form sheaves of categories on GelfStk (ALRS Lemma 2.1.8, p. 16, ALRS line 820; ALRS Lemma 2.1.10, p. 17, ALRS line 861), using the criterion that a sheaf of categories on an ∞-topos descends to a cotopological localization if and only if it is fully faithful along the localizing maps (ALRS Lemma 2.1.9, p. 16, ALRS line 841).

A proof route: Dualizability is !-local and dualizable modules over a Gelfand ring are perfect by the Fredholm property 1.7; perfect amplitude descends (Sch24 Corollary VI.1.3). Inversion of !-equivalences follows from full faithfulness of Perf ⊂ D and the hypercover criterion of the contract `analytic-stacks`, item (f). For D^+, a descendable map has a nilpotent fibre power (EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E5:descent), so B is descendable in D^+(A) and Lemma 2.1.9 applies; for nuclear modules use pro-constancy of the partial totalizations.

*Needs:* §1.7; §2.1; §2.2; required contract `analytic-stacks`; required contract `analytic-stacks-betti-nuclear`; EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E5:descent; EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E5:presentability.4.

**Checks.**

- Perf(GSpec(ℚ_p)) is the category of bounded complexes of finite-dimensional ℚ_p-vector spaces, and Perf(∅) = 0.
- For the descendable map ℚ_p → ℚ_p^cyc (it has a ℚ_p-linear retraction), a perfect ℚ_p^cyc-complex with descent datum for the Čech conerve descends to a perfect ℚ_p-complex of the same amplitude.
- The object ℚ_p⟨T⟩ ∈ D(GSpec(ℚ_p)) is eventually connective and nuclear but not dualizable, so the three sheaves of categories are distinct.

### 2.4 Nilperfectoid rings form a basis of the !-topology

Prove: (1) every separable Gelfand ring A admits a descendable map A → A′ with A′ separable nilperfectoid, quasi-pro-étale after uniform completion; (2) every separable qfd Gelfand ring admits a descendable map to a separable qfd strictly totally disconnected nilperfectoid ring; (3) for an arc-hypercover A → A^• of qfd perfectoid rings, colim_Δ GSpec(A^•) → GSpec(A) is a !-equivalence (ALRS Theorem 2.1.7, p. 15, ALRS line 797; ABLB Proposition 4.6.4, p. 55, ABLB line 2916; ABLB Corollary 4.4.10, p. 50, ABLB line 2641).

A proof route: For (1), choose a surjection onto A^u from ℚ_p⟨T_n : n ∈ ℕ⟩, base change the descendable map colim_n ℚ_p⟨T_1,…,T_n⟩ → ℚ_p⟨T_n : n ∈ ℕ⟩ (index ≤ 2, EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E5:descent, isDescendable_colimit_of_uniformIndex) to get A′ with A′^{†-red} = A′^u, then pass to a perfectoid quasi-pro-étale cover; for (2) use the strictly totally disconnected basis of MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII §BM.0 and ind-finite étale covers; (3) is the almost-mathematics descent of ABLB §4.4 (Lemmas 4.4.3–4.4.9).

*Needs:* EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E2.6; §1.8; §2.1; §2.3; MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII §BM.0; PerfectoidSpaces §P2.10; EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E5:descent; required contract `analytic-stacks`.

**Checks.**

- For A = ℚ_p the map ℚ_p → ℚ_p^cyc is descendable and lands in a nilperfectoid ring.
- A nilperfectoid ring is its own cover; for A = 0 the empty family covers.
- ℚ_p is totally disconnected but not strictly totally disconnected, since its residue field ℚ_p is not algebraically closed; (2) requires passing to C_p-type covers.

### 2.5 Betti realization of condensed anima

Construct the colimit-preserving Betti realization (−)^Betti: CondAni → GelfStk^qfd, left adjoint in a morphism of ∞-topoi, sending a light profinite set S to GSpec(C^lc(S, ℚ_p)), the spectrum of the solid ℚ_p-algebra of locally constant functions (ABLB Lemma 4.2.9, p. 42, ABLB line 2214; ALRS §2.1, p. 13, ALRS line 671). For a qfd Gelfand ring A construct the natural map GSpec(A) → M(A)^Betti, and for a qfd derived Berkovich space X the map X → |X|^Betti (ALRS §2.2, p. 18, ALRS line 925).

A proof route: For a hypercover S^• → S of light profinite sets the pro-system of partial totalizations of C^lc(S^•, ℚ_p) is pro-isomorphic to C^lc(S, ℚ_p), which already holds with ℤ-coefficients.

*Needs:* §2.1; §1.5; Mathlib `LightProfinite`; Mathlib `LightCondensed`; required contract `analytic-stacks-betti-nuclear`.

The API has the following laws.

- For a light profinite S, S^Betti = GSpec(C^lc(S, ℚ_p)).
- (−)^Betti preserves colimits and finite limits.
- For a qfd Gelfand ring A there is a natural map GSpec(A) → M(A)^Betti, compatible with rational localizations, which on the open subset U ⊂ M(A) recovers the open subspace GSpec(A)_U.

**Checks.**

- The Betti realization of a two-point set is GSpec(ℚ_p × ℚ_p) and that of the empty set is GSpec(0).
- For S = ℕ ∪ {∞}, C^lc(S, ℚ_p) consists of eventually constant sequences and is not the Banach algebra C(S, ℚ_p) of convergent sequences; GSpec(C(S, ℚ_p)) is the continuous incarnation S^cont, distinct from S^Betti.
- The point realizes to GSpec(ℚ_p), the final Gelfand stack.

### 2.6 Derived Berkovich spaces, †-rigid spaces and rigid spaces

Define the analytic topology on affinoid Gelfand stacks: a cover of GSpec(A) is a finite family of †-rational localizations whose spectra form a strict closed cover of M(A), that is, one refined by an open cover. A derived Berkovich space is a sheaf for this topology admitting an open cover by open subspaces of affinoid Gelfand stacks; it has an underlying topological space |X| = colim |GSpec(A)| (ABLB Definition 4.3.1, p. 44, ABLB line 2295; ALRS §2.2, p. 17, ALRS line 894). Prove that the left Kan extension BerkSp → GelfStk is fully faithful (ABLB Proposition 4.3.3, p. 44, ABLB line 2330). A †-rigid space over a separable nonarchimedean field K is a derived Berkovich space locally represented by a static quotient of an overconvergent Tate algebra K⟨T_1,…,T_n⟩_{≤r} (ABLB Definition 4.3.6, p. 45, ABLB line 2384). For a rigid space X over a qfd Banach field define X′ = colim GSpec(A) over open affinoids Spa(A, A^+) ⊂ X; prove that X ↦ X′ sends rational covers to epimorphisms, depends only on the canonical compactification of X, and restricts to a fully faithful functor from partially proper rigid spaces to derived Berkovich spaces, with Spa(A, A^+) ↦ GSpec(A) on affinoids (ALRS Example 2.2.2, p. 17, ALRS line 910).

A proof route: Full faithfulness reduces to the statement that the realization of a strict analytic cover is a !-equivalence (ABLB Proposition 4.3.3); for partially proper rigid spaces the Tate-rational and †-rational gluings agree because every point has a neighbourhood basis of †-rational subspaces whose interiors cover.

*Needs:* §1.6; §2.1; §2.5; TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.17; TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.19; RigidAnalyticGeometry §6.2; AdicSpacesPartII §R1.1; AdicSpacesPartII §R0.10; AdicSpacesPartIV §F1.7.

The API has the following laws.

- Every derived Berkovich space X has a topological space |X|, with |GSpec(A)| = M(A), functorial in maps.
- Open subsets U ⊂ |X| define open subspaces X_U → X, and these are exactly the open immersions.
- BerkSp → GelfStk and BerkSp^qfd → GelfStk^qfd are fully faithful.
- Partially proper rigid spaces over K embed fully faithfully into derived Berkovich spaces, and dagger spaces in the sense of AdicSpacesPartIV §F1.7 give †-rigid spaces.
- For a K-affinoid algebra A in the sense of TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.17, |GSpec(A)| is its Berkovich spectrum, and affinoid and rational domains (§0.19) correspond to †-rational localizations with the same spectra.

**Checks.**

- The open unit disc is a partially proper rigid space whose derived Berkovich space has |X| the open Berkovich disc.
- The rigid closed disc Spa(ℚ_p⟨T⟩, ℤ_p⟨T⟩) and its canonical compactification have the same Gelfand stack GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩), so X ↦ X′ is not injective on rigid spaces that are not partially proper.
- GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩_{≤1}) and GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩) have the same underlying space and different Gelfand stacks: the first is a †-rigid space and is Berkovich-smooth, the second is the canonical compactification of the closed disc and is not Berkovich-smooth (ALRS Warning 2.6.13).
- The empty sheaf is a derived Berkovich space with empty underlying space.

### 2.7 Relative spectra, Toën-affine maps and the Betti projection

For a qfd Gelfand stack X and A ∈ CAlg(D(X)) define GSpec_X(A) as the functor on Gelfand rings f: GSpec(R) → X with value Map_{CAlg(D(R))}(f^*A, R) (ALRS Definition 2.2.3, p. 18, ALRS line 937). Prove that it is a qfd Gelfand stack, compatible with base change, that GSpec_X(f_*O_Y) = Y for a map f: Y → X of affinoid Gelfand stacks, and define the relative affinization and Toën-affine maps (prim maps for which Y → GSpec_X(f_*O_Y) is an equivalence), a property local on the target (ALRS Remark 2.2.4, p. 18, ALRS line 941). Prove that for a qfd derived Berkovich space X the map h: X → |X|^Betti is Toën-affine and D-proper, so that X = GSpec_{|X|^Betti}(h_*O_X) (ALRS Lemma 2.2.5, p. 18, ALRS line 964).

A proof route: Toën-affineness of X → |X|^Betti is local on the target; covering |X|^Betti by light profinite S_i, each base change X ×_{|X|} S_i is affinoid (ABLB Proposition 3.2.10), and maps of affinoid Gelfand stacks are D-proper.

*Needs:* §2.3; §2.5; §2.6; required contract `analytic-stacks`.

The API has the following laws.

- For g: Y → X, Y ×_X GSpec_X(A) ≅ GSpec_Y(g^*A).
- For f: GSpec(B) → GSpec(A), GSpec_{GSpec(A)}(f_*O) = GSpec(B).
- Toën-affineness is local on the target for epimorphisms of Gelfand stacks.
- For a qfd derived Berkovich space X, h: X → |X|^Betti is Toën-affine and D-proper, and h_*O_X is the sheaf U ↦ O(X_U) on |X|.

**Checks.**

- For X = GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩), h_*O is the sheaf on the Berkovich disc assigning to a †-rational closed subset its overconvergent function ring, and GSpec_{|X|}(h_*O) recovers X.
- For A = ℚ_p[u^{±1}] with u of homological degree 2, GSpec_X(A) = ∅ although A ≠ 0, because a homogeneous unit of positive degree cannot map to a connective ring (ALRS Remark 2.2.4(4)).
- GSpec_X(O_X) = X for every qfd Gelfand stack X.

### 2.8 Light arc-stacks and perfectoidization

Define the ∞-category ArcStk_{ℚ_p} of light arc-stacks over Marc(ℚ_p) as hypersheaves of anima on the arc-site of separable perfectoid spaces over ℚ_p, and its qfd variant on separable qfd perfectoid spaces (ABLB Definition 4.1.8, p. 39, ABLB line 2023; ABLB Definition 4.1.11(3), p. 39, ABLB line 2067). For a separable Banach algebra A let Marc(A) be the arc-sheaf of pairs (R^♯, A → R^♯) of an untilt and a map of Banach algebras; tilting identifies ArcStk_{ℚ_p} with arc-stacks over Marc(ℚ_p) on perfectoid spaces of characteristic p (ALRS §2.3, p. 19, ALRS line 996). Construct the perfectoidization functor (−)^⋄: GelfStk → ArcStk_{ℚ_p} by restriction along totally disconnected perfectoid affinoids, colimit-preserving, with GSpec(A)^⋄ = Marc(A^u), and its left adjoint X ↦ X̂ which preserves fibre products but not the final object (ABLB Proposition 4.5.4, p. 51, ABLB line 2729; ABLB Proposition 4.5.5, p. 52, ABLB line 2737; ALRS §2.3, p. 19, ALRS line 1005). Compare Marc(A) with the Banach arc-site of MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII §BM.0.

A proof route: Geometric realizations of arc-hypercovers of separable strictly totally disconnected perfectoid rings are !-equivalences (2.4(3)), so restriction to perfectoids defines (−)^⋄ with a left adjoint (ABLB Lemma 4.4.3, Proposition 4.5.5).

*Needs:* §2.1; §2.4; MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII §BM.0; PerfectoidSpaces §P1.27; PerfectoidSpaces §P2.10; EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E2.7.

The API has the following laws.

- GSpec(A)^⋄ = Marc(A) = Marc(A^u) for every separable Gelfand ring A.
- (−)^⋄ preserves colimits and finite limits, and is itself the inverse image of a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi (ALRS §2.3, ALRS line 1016).
- For a qfd nilperfectoid A, the left adjoint sends Marc(A^u) to GSpec(A^u).
- For a separable Banach ℚ_p-algebra A, Marc(A) agrees on separable perfectoid spaces with the arc-sheafified representable of MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII §BM.0 arc-site.

**Checks.**

- GSpec(ℚ_p[ε]/ε²)^⋄ = Marc(ℚ_p) = GSpec(ℚ_p)^⋄: perfectoidization forgets †-nilpotent thickenings.
- GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩_{≤1})^⋄ = GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩)^⋄ = Marc(ℚ_p⟨T⟩).
- The left adjoint X ↦ X̂ preserves fibre products but not the final object (ALRS line 1015): the final arc-stack Marc(ℚ_p) is not sent to the final Gelfand stack GSpec(ℚ_p), so X̂ is not the inverse image of a geometric morphism.

### Examples

GSpec(ℚ_p) is the final Gelfand stack and GSpec(0) the initial one. The Betti realization of a two-point set is GSpec(ℚ_p × ℚ_p). The open unit disc is a partially proper rigid space and a derived Berkovich space; the closed disc Spa(ℚ_p⟨T⟩, ℤ_p⟨T⟩) and its canonical compactification have the same Gelfand stack GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩). The perfectoidization of GSpec(ℚ_p[ε]/ε²) is Marc(ℚ_p).

### Dependencies

Layer 1; required contracts `analytic-stacks` and `analytic-stacks-betti-nuclear`; EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E2.6, §E2.7, §E5:descent, §E5:presentability.4; TropicalAndBerkovichArithmetic §0.17, §0.19; RigidAnalyticGeometry §6.2; AdicSpacesPartII §R1.1, §R0.10; AdicSpacesPartIV §F1.7; PerfectoidSpaces §P2.10; MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII §BM.0.

## Layer 3: Analytic de Rham stacks, analytification and Cartier divisors

This layer constructs the analytic de Rham stack as the right adjoint of perfectoidization and records its descent and cohomological properties, defines locally analytic points, analytifies étale algebraic stacks into Gelfand stacks, and identifies maps to BG_m and A¹/G_m with line bundles and generalized Cartier divisors. From here on all Gelfand rings, Gelfand stacks and arc-stacks are separable and qfd.

### 3.1 The analytic de Rham stack

Define the analytic de Rham stack (−)^dR: ArcStk^qfd_{ℚ_p} → GelfStk^qfd as the right adjoint of perfectoidization; explicitly, for a qfd nilperfectoid ℚ_p-algebra A, X^dR(A) = X(Marc(A^u)), and for a qfd Gelfand stack X put X^dR = (X^⋄)^dR, so that X^dR(A) = X(A^u) (ALRS Definition 2.3.1, p. 19, ALRS line 1017; ALRS Remark 2.3.2, p. 20, ALRS line 1027). For a map Y → X define the relative de Rham stack Y^{dR/X} = X ×_{X^dR} Y^dR. Prove that for a qfd derived Berkovich space X, X^dR is the !-sheafification of A ↦ X(A^{†-red}), that for a map Z → X of qfd derived Berkovich spaces whose map of arc-stacks is an immersion Z^{dR/X} is the overconvergent neighbourhood X^†_Z, and that for a †-rigid space X over a qfd field K, X → X^{dR/K} is prim and descendable with Čech nerve (X^{×_K (n+1)})^†_Δ (ABLB Proposition 4.7.12, p. 59, ABLB line 3155; ABLB Theorem 4.7.15, p. 61, ABLB line 3248).

A proof route: The right adjoint exists because perfectoidization is a colimit-preserving functor between presentable categories; its value on nilperfectoids is computed from the qfd identification \hat{Marc(A^u)} = GSpec(A^u) of 2.8. The presentations follow ABLB §4.7 (RC24 Theorem 5.4.1 adapted).

*Needs:* §2.8; §2.4; §2.6; required contract `analytic-stacks`.

The API has the following laws.

- Maps Y → X^dR of qfd Gelfand stacks are equivalent to maps Y^⋄ → X of arc-stacks.
- For a qfd nilperfectoid A and a qfd Gelfand stack X, X^dR(A) = X(A^u); in particular X^dR(A) depends only on A^u.
- The unit X → X^dR induces (X^dR)^dR ≅ X^dR, and X^dR → GSpec(ℚ_p) is †-formally étale.
- For an immersion Z → X of qfd derived Berkovich spaces on arc-stacks, Z^{dR/X} = X^†_Z.

**Checks.**

- For A¹, (A¹)^dR(A) = A^u-points = A/Nil†(A) on nilperfectoids, so (A¹)^dR = A¹/G_a^† with G_a^†(A) = Nil†(A) = GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩_{≤0})(A) acting by translation (ABLB Theorem 4.7.15).
- GSpec(ℚ_p[ε]/ε²)^dR = GSpec(ℚ_p)^dR = GSpec(ℚ_p), since both have perfectoidization Marc(ℚ_p).
- A¹ → (A¹)^dR is not an isomorphism: over A = C_p[ε]/ε² the points ε and 0 of A¹(A) have the same image.
- The empty arc-stack has empty de Rham stack: ∅^dR(A) = ∅(Marc(A^u)) is empty for every nonzero nilperfectoid A.

### 3.2 Exactness and arc-hyperdescent of the de Rham stack

Prove that (−)^dR: ArcStk^qfd_{ℚ_p} → GelfStk^qfd is left exact and commutes with all colimits, hence is the inverse image of a geometric morphism; in particular, for an arc-hypercover X_• → X of qfd arc-stacks, |X^dR_•| → X^dR is an equivalence, and epimorphisms go to epimorphisms (ABLB Theorem 5.6.6, p. 90, ABLB line 4799; ABLB Theorem 5.6.1, p. 87, ABLB line 4629; ABLB Theorem 4.8.7, p. 64, ABLB line 3384). Prove that (−)^dR and the left adjoint of perfectoidization are fully faithful (ABLB Proposition 4.5.7, p. 52, ABLB line 2752).

A proof route: Commutation with colimits reduces, by the adjunction between perfectoid and nilperfectoid affinoids, to arc-hyperdescent of qfd affinoid perfectoid rings for the pullback functor (ABLB Theorem 5.6.1), which is proved through nuclear modules and the cohomology of de Rham stacks of overconvergent polydiscs (ABLB §§5.5–5.6).

*Needs:* §3.1; §2.3; §2.4; required contract `analytic-stacks-betti-nuclear`.

**Checks.**

- For a locally profinite group G with classifying arc-stack BG, (BG)^dR = BG^sm, where G^sm has the locally constant ℚ_p-valued functions (ABLB Remark 1.2.6).
- The de Rham stack of a disjoint union of two qfd arc-stacks is the disjoint union of their de Rham stacks.
- Without the qfd restriction the big de Rham stack satisfies the other assertions but is not known to commute with colimits (ABLB Remark 1.2.6), which is why the qfd setting is imposed.

### 3.3 Cohomological properness and smoothness of de Rham stacks

Prove: (1) if a map f: Y → X of qfd arc-stacks over ℚ_p is arc-locally on X locally of quasi-finite dimension (lqfd: strict closed covers by pieces qcqs and quasi-pro-étale over a relative affine space), then f^dR is !-able, and cohomologically proper if f is proper (ABLB Proposition 5.1.4, p. 67, ABLB line 3512); (2) if f is smooth (arc-locally on X and analytically on Y étale over a relative affine space) of pure dimension d, then f^dR is cohomologically smooth with dualizing complex O[2d], and cohomologically étale when f is étale (ABLB Theorem 5.1.7, p. 68, ABLB line 3567); (3) for the open punctured pre-perfectoid unit disc X = lim_{x↦x^p} D̊^{×,⋄}, X^dR → GSpec(ℚ_p) is cohomologically smooth with dualizing complex O[2] (ABLB Proposition 5.7.1, p. 91, ABLB line 4860).

A proof route: As in ABLB §5.1: !-ability is local on the source for strict closed covers, reducing to Y quasi-pro-étale over A^d_X, where de Rham stacks of quasi-pro-étale maps and of A^{d,dR}_X → X^dR are !-able; smoothness reduces by HM Lemmas 4.5.7–4.5.8 to the open disc, treated through the overconvergent de Rham cohomology of polydiscs.

*Needs:* §3.2; §2.2; required contract `analytic-stacks`; required contract `solid-serre-duality`.

**Checks.**

- For A^{d,⋄} → Marc(ℚ_p) the dualizing complex is O[2d]; for d = 0 it is O.
- The dualizing complex of a smooth de Rham stack carries no Frobenius twist; the Tate twist O⟨1⟩[2] of 6.3 appears only after passing to Hyodo–Kato stacks.
- The open disc is smooth and not proper over Marc(ℚ_p), so its de Rham stack is cohomologically smooth but f^dR_! ≠ f^dR_*.

### 3.4 Locally analytic points

For a rigid space X over ℚ_p, viewed as a Gelfand stack, define X(ℚ_p)^la := X ×_{X^dR} (X(ℚ_p))^dR, where X(ℚ_p) is the locally profinite set of ℚ_p-points (ALRS Definition 2.3.3, p. 20, ALRS line 1032). When X is a rigid analytic group, X(ℚ_p)^la is a group object in Gelfand stacks; for a p-adic Lie group G define G^cont = GSpec(C(G, ℚ_p)) locally and G^sm with the locally constant functions, so that there are group maps G^cont → G^la → G^sm (ALRS footnote 6, p. 6, ALRS line 326).

*Needs:* §3.1; §2.5; §2.6.

The API has the following laws.

- If X is a rigid analytic group then X(ℚ_p)^la is a group object and X(ℚ_p)^la → X is a group map.
- The de Rham stack of X(ℚ_p)^la is X(ℚ_p)^dR = X(ℚ_p)^sm, the Betti realization of the locally profinite set X(ℚ_p).
- For a nilperfectoid A, X(ℚ_p)^la(A) is the set of points x ∈ X(A) whose image in X(A^u) comes from a locally constant map M(A) → X(ℚ_p).

**Checks.**

- A¹(ℚ_p)^la = ℚ_p^la, and ℚ_p^la(ℚ_p[ε]/ε²) = ℚ_p ⊕ ℚ_p·ε while ℚ_p^sm(ℚ_p[ε]/ε²) = ℚ_p; the extra tangent direction distinguishes locally analytic from locally constant.
- ℚ_p^la(C_p[ε]/ε²) = {a + bε : a ∈ ℚ_p, b ∈ C_p}, because the reduction modulo the †-nilradical must be a constant in ℚ_p.
- For X = GSpec(ℚ_p), X(ℚ_p)^la = GSpec(ℚ_p).

### 3.5 Analytification of étale algebraic stacks and Tannakian stacks

For an affinoid Gelfand stack S = GSpec(R) and an affine derived scheme Spec(R′) over Spec(R(*)) define (Spec R′)^an(A) = Map_{R(*)}(R′, A(*)). Prove that this extends uniquely to a colimit-preserving and finite-limit-preserving functor (−)^an from étale sheaves on affine derived schemes over Spec(R(*)) to Gelfand stacks over S, the !-sheafification of A ↦ X(A(*)) (ALRS Lemma 2.4.1, p. 20, ALRS line 1053). Define Tannakian, strongly Tannakian and perfect étale algebraic stacks (ALRS Definition 2.4.2, p. 21, ALRS line 1092). Prove that for a perfect strongly Tannakian X over Spec(R(*)) the presheaf A ↦ X(Spec A(*)) is already a Gelfand stack equal to X^an, and that maps Y → X^an from a Gelfand stack Y over S are the Perf(R)-linear symmetric monoidal functors Perf(X) → Perf(Y) whose extension to QCoh(X) sends connective pseudo-coherent objects to locally connective objects (ALRS Proposition 2.4.5, p. 22, ALRS line 1143).

A proof route: Étale covers of finitely presented schemes become rigid étale surjections, hence !-covers. For the Tannakian statement use that perfect complexes form a sheaf of categories on GelfStk (2.3) and that connectivity of discrete pseudo-coherent complexes is !-local (Sch24 Proposition VI.1.2, in the contract).

*Needs:* §2.3; §1.7; SchemeAndStackFoundations §1.18; SchemeAndStackFoundations §1.19; SchemeAndStackFoundations §1.22; ReductiveGroups Layer 1; DerivedModuleAlgebra §1.E.0; required contract `analytic-stacks-betti-nuclear`.

**Checks.**

- (A^{1,sch})^an = A¹ with A¹(A) = A(*), and (G_m^{sch})^an = G_m with G_m(A) = A(*)^×; A¹ is the increasing union of the discs GSpec(ℚ_p⟨p^n T⟩), not the closed disc GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩).
- B G_m^{sch} and A^{1,sch}/G_m^{sch} over a field of characteristic zero are perfect and strongly Tannakian (ALRS Example 2.4.4(3)), so their analytifications have the functor-of-points description.
- The analytification of Spec(R(*)) is S itself.

### 3.6 Line bundles, BG_m and generalized Cartier divisors

Prove that for a Gelfand stack X the anima Map(X, BG_m) is equivalent to the anima of line bundles in D(X), the objects that are ∗-locally perfect of amplitude 0 and rank 1 (ALRS Lemma 2.5.2, p. 22, ALRS line 1178), and that Map(X, A¹/G_m) is equivalent to the anima of generalized Cartier divisors (L, s: L → O_X) with L a line bundle; if X is a derived Berkovich space this is also the anima of maps Z → X which are analytically locally the derived zero locus of a function. The correspondences send g: X → A¹/G_m to its pullback along {0}/G_m → A¹/G_m, f: Z → X to L = fib(O_X → f_*O_Z), and (L, s) to the descent of the G_m-equivariant map V(L)^× → A¹ (ALRS Proposition 2.5.3, p. 23, ALRS line 1197). In this roadmap "Cartier divisor" always means generalized Cartier divisor in this sense.

A proof route: Locally on a Gelfand ring a line bundle is a rank one projective module in degree 0 by the Fredholm property, trivialized after a †-rational localization; automorphisms of the trivial bundle are A(*)^×. For A¹/G_m, sections of L lift !-locally to functions, and triangles O → O over the identity are indexed by units.

*Needs:* §3.5; §2.3; §1.7; SchemeAndStackFoundations §1.21; SchemeAndStackFoundations §1.15.

The API has the following laws.

- Map(X, BG_m) ≅ line bundles on X, compatibly with pullback and tensor product.
- Map(X, A¹/G_m) ≅ pairs (L, s: L → O_X), compatibly with pullback; tensor product of pairs corresponds to the multiplication A¹/G_m × A¹/G_m → A¹/G_m.
- The divisor Z = X ×_{A¹/G_m} BG_m attached to (L, s) has O_Z = cofib(s), and the divisor is empty if and only if s is an isomorphism.

**Checks.**

- Over GSpec(ℚ_p) there are two isomorphism classes of Cartier divisors: s ≠ 0 gives the empty divisor and s = 0 gives the derived zero locus GSpec(ℚ_p ⊕ ℚ_p[1]), which is neither empty nor GSpec(ℚ_p).
- On GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩), (O, T) has zero locus GSpec(ℚ_p) at the origin; (O, T²) has zero locus GSpec(ℚ_p[T]/T²), and (O, 1) is empty.
- The universal Cartier divisor on A¹/G_m has ideal sheaf the line bundle I of weight −1, and its divisor is BG_m = {0}/G_m; this fixes the sign of the G_m-weights used for cones in Layer 5.

### Examples

The de Rham stack of the analytic affine line is A¹/G_a^†, where G_a^†(A) = Nil†(A). The locally analytic points of A¹ over ℚ_p[ε]/ε² are ℚ_p ⊕ ℚ_p·ε, whereas the locally constant ones are ℚ_p. Over GSpec(ℚ_p) a Cartier divisor is (O, s) with s ∈ ℚ_p up to units: either the empty divisor (s ≠ 0) or the derived zero locus GSpec(ℚ_p ⊕ ℚ_p[1]) (s = 0).

### Dependencies

Layer 2; required contracts `analytic-stacks` and `analytic-stacks-betti-nuclear`; SchemeAndStackFoundations §1.18–§1.22; ReductiveGroups Layer 1; EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E5:presentability.4; DerivedModuleAlgebra §1.E.0.

## Layer 4: Morphisms, pushouts, †-cohesiveness and deformation theory

This layer fixes the classes of morphisms used throughout (†-formally étale and smooth maps, immersions, rigid and Berkovich étale and smooth maps, Zariski closed immersions), constructs the pushouts of Berkovich spaces along Zariski closed immersions that underlie thickened Fargues–Fontaine curves, introduces †-cohesive maps, and develops the deformation theory of Gelfand stacks: cotangent complexes, infinitesimal cohesiveness, the †-quasi-pro-étale topology and tangent complexes of classifying stacks.

### 4.1 †-formally étale and †-formally smooth maps

Prove that for a map f: Y → X of Gelfand stacks the following are equivalent: (1) Y → Y^{dR/X} is an isomorphism; (2) for every Gelfand ring A, Y(A) → X(A) ×_{X^⋄(Marc(A^{†-red}))} Y^⋄(Marc(A^{†-red})) is an isomorphism; (3) for every nilperfectoid A, Y(A) → X(A) ×_{X(A^u)} Y(A^u) is an isomorphism; call such f †-formally étale (ALRS Lemma 2.6.1, p. 24, ALRS line 1248; ABLB Definition 4.7.2, p. 57, ABLB line 3051). Define f to be †-formally smooth (the map in (3) is an epimorphism for nilperfectoid A), weakly †-formally smooth (Y → Y^{dR/X} is an epimorphism), strongly †-formally smooth (Y(A) → X(A) ×_{X(A^{†-red})} Y(A^{†-red}) is an epimorphism for every Gelfand ring A), and †-formally étale locally †-formally smooth (†-formally smooth after †-formally étale epimorphisms on source and target), with the implications strong ⇒ †-formally smooth ⇒ étale-locally ⇒ weak (ALRS Definition 2.6.4, p. 24, ALRS line 1275). Prove that a weakly †-formally smooth map is an epimorphism if and only if f^⋄ is (ALRS Lemma 2.6.5, p. 24, ALRS line 1293).

A proof route: (2) ⇒ (1) ⇒ (3) are formal; for (3) ⇒ (2) cover A by a nilperfectoid B with nilperfectoid Čech nerve (2.4) and pass to the limit, using that Marc(B^u) → Marc(A^{†-red}) is an arc-cover. Lemma 2.6.5 factors f as Y → Y^{dR/X} → X, the second map being a base change of (f^⋄)^dR.

*Needs:* §3.1; §2.4; §1.6.

The API has the following laws.

- †-formally étale maps are stable under base change and composition and satisfy cancellation; †-rational localizations of Berkovich spaces are †-formally étale.
- For every map Y → X, Y^{dR/X} → X is †-formally étale.
- Strongly †-formally smooth ⇒ †-formally smooth ⇒ †-formally étale locally †-formally smooth ⇒ weakly †-formally smooth.
- A weakly †-formally smooth map is an epimorphism of Gelfand stacks if and only if its perfectoidization is an epimorphism of arc-stacks.

**Checks.**

- A †-rational localization GSpec(A⟨f/g⟩_{≤1}) → GSpec(A) is †-formally étale (ABLB Proposition 3.1.9).
- The zero section 0 → A¹ is not †-formally étale: for A = C_p[ε]/ε² the target set X(A) ×_{X(A^u)} Y(A^u) is Nil†(A) = C_p·ε, while Y(A) is a point.
- GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩) → GSpec(ℚ_p) has cotangent complex ℚ_p⟨T⟩dT (formally smooth in 4.6) but is not †-formally smooth (ALRS Remark 2.6.6; ABLB Example 4.7.7).
- Isomorphisms are †-formally étale.

### 4.2 Immersions, rigid and Berkovich étale and smooth maps

For a map f: Y → X of Berkovich spaces define: f is an open (closed, locally closed) immersion if |Y| → |X| is one and Y → |Y|^Betti ×_{|X|^Betti} X is an isomorphism, equivalently f is †-formally étale and f^⋄ is an open (closed, locally closed) immersion of arc-stacks (ALRS Definition 2.6.8, p. 25, ALRS line 1321); finite étale maps (ALRS Remark 2.6.7, p. 25, ALRS line 1309); rigid étale maps (analytically locally composites of open immersions and finite étale maps) and rigid smooth maps (analytically locally rigid étale over A^n_X) (ALRS Definition 2.6.10, p. 25, ALRS line 1332); Berkovich-étale maps (locally on strict closed covers composites of †-rational localizations and finite étale maps) and Berkovich-smooth maps (locally Berkovich-étale over A^n_X) (ALRS Definition 2.6.12, p. 25, ALRS line 1344). Prove that rigid smooth maps are analytically locally strongly †-formally smooth (ALRS Lemma 2.6.11, p. 25, ALRS line 1339) and that smooth partially proper rigid spaces over a nonarchimedean field are rigid smooth (ALRS Warning 2.6.13, p. 25, ALRS line 1351).

A proof route: Lemma 2.6.11 reduces to the solid smooth case of RC24 Proposition 3.7.5 (solid étale maps of bounded affinoid rings are †-formally étale, solid smooth maps †-formally smooth).

*Needs:* §4.1; §2.6; §1.6; AdicEtaleGeometry §A2.4; AdicSpacesPartII §R0.16.

The API has the following laws.

- Rigid étale maps are Berkovich-étale and rigid smooth maps are Berkovich-smooth; Berkovich-étale maps are †-formally étale.
- Being an open or closed immersion is local on the target for !-covers, which therefore defines open and closed immersions of Gelfand stacks.
- A smooth morphism of partially proper rigid spaces (AdicSpacesPartII §R0.16, AdicEtaleGeometry §A2.4) is rigid smooth on the associated Berkovich spaces.

**Checks.**

- The open unit disc is rigid smooth over ℚ_p.
- The overconvergent closed disc GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩_{≤1}) is Berkovich-smooth but not rigid smooth.
- The closed disc GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩), the canonical compactification, is neither Berkovich-smooth nor rigid smooth.
- A †-rational localization onto a closed subdisc is Berkovich-étale but not rigid étale, since its image is not open.

### 4.3 Zariski closed immersions and pushouts of Berkovich spaces

Call a map f: Z → X of Berkovich spaces Zariski closed if it is Toën-affine and locally on a strict closed affinoid cover X_i = GSpec(A_i) the map A_i → f_{i,*}O_{Z_i} is surjective on π_0 with connective target (ALRS Definition 2.7.1, p. 26, ALRS line 1366). Prove: (1) for Zariski closed f: Z → Y and g: Z → X the pushout X ⊔_Z Y exists in Berkovich spaces, with |X ⊔_Z Y| = |X| ⊔_{|Z|} |Y| and, in the affinoid case with π_0-surjective maps, X ⊔_Z Y = GSpec(O(X) ×_{O(Z)} O(Y)) (ALRS Lemma 2.7.3, p. 26, ALRS line 1375); (2) for g: GSpec(A) → GSpec(A′) inducing an isomorphism on uniform completions and f: GSpec(A) → X Zariski closed, X ⊔_{GSpec A} GSpec(A′) exists with space |X| and structure sheaf O_X ×_{O_Z} O_{Z′} (ALRS Lemma 2.7.4, p. 27, ALRS line 1441); (3) for connective solid ℚ_p-algebras A → B ← C with A → B surjective and D = A ×_B C, the functor D(D) → D(A) ×_{D(B)} D(C) is fully faithful, an equivalence on D^+, and an equivalence on Perf when A, B, C are Gelfand (ALRS Lemma 2.7.5, p. 27, ALRS line 1461).

A proof route: In the affinoid case identify |GSpec(B ×_A C)| with the pushout of spectra pointwise, using a †-rational localization inverting an element of the kernel; glue by analytic descent. For (3) construct the right adjoint (N, M) ↦ N ×_K M and prove the unit is an equivalence; essential surjectivity on D^+ uses projectivity of ℤ_■[S] and a connectivity induction; Perf follows by passing to dualizable objects and the Fredholm property.

*Needs:* §2.6; §2.7; §2.3; §1.7.

**Checks.**

- The pushout of two copies of GSpec(ℚ_p⟨T⟩) along their origins is GSpec(ℚ_p⟨S, T⟩/(ST)).
- Lemma 2.7.5 fails for full module categories: for A = C = ℚ_p[T], B = ℚ_p, the pair (⊕_{n even} B[n], ⊕_{n odd} B[n]) lies in D(A) ×_{D(B)} D(C) but not in the image of D(D) (ALRS Example 2.7.6).
- Zariski closed immersions do not satisfy !-descent: the inclusion of a disc of radius 1/2 into a disc of radius 1 becomes Zariski closed after base change to a strictly totally disconnected cover but is not Zariski closed (ALRS Example 2.7.2).
- For Z = ∅ the pushout is the disjoint union X ⊔ Y.

### 4.4 †-thickenings and †-cohesive maps

Call a map A → B of Gelfand rings a †-thickening if it is surjective and induces an isomorphism on †-reductions. Call a map f: Y → X of Gelfand stacks †-cohesive if for every †-thickening B → A and every surjection C → A of Gelfand rings the square with corners Y(B ×_A C), Y(B) ×_{Y(A)} Y(C), X(B ×_A C), X(B) ×_{X(A)} X(C) is cartesian (ALRS Definition 2.7.7, p. 29, ALRS line 1538). Prove that maps of Berkovich spaces are †-cohesive, that Perf(−) is †-cohesive, that X^an → GSpec(R) is †-cohesive for a perfect strongly Tannakian X (ALRS Example 2.7.8, p. 29, ALRS line 1546), and that †-cohesive maps satisfy two-out-of-three over a †-cohesive base, are stable under base change, and include all †-formally étale maps (ALRS Lemma 2.7.9, p. 29, ALRS line 1555).

*Needs:* §4.3; §4.1; §3.5; §2.3.

The API has the following laws.

- Every morphism of Berkovich spaces is †-cohesive (by 4.3(2)).
- If f: Y → X is †-cohesive then g: Z → Y is †-cohesive if and only if f ∘ g is; base changes of †-cohesive maps are †-cohesive.
- †-formally étale maps are †-cohesive; in particular every de Rham stack Y^dR → GSpec(ℚ_p) is †-cohesive.

**Checks.**

- ℚ_p[ε]/ε² → ℚ_p is a †-thickening; ℚ_p⟨T⟩ → ℚ_p (T ↦ 0) is surjective but not a †-thickening, since the †-reductions differ.
- For B = ℚ_p[ε]/ε² → A = ℚ_p and C = ℚ_p⟨T⟩ → ℚ_p, Perf(B ×_A C) ≅ Perf(B) ×_{Perf(A)} Perf(C) by 4.3(3).
- GSpec(ℚ_p) → GSpec(ℚ_p) is †-cohesive.

### 4.5 Cotangent complexes of Gelfand rings

For a map A → B of solid animated ℤ-algebras let L_{B/A} ∈ D_{≥0}(B) corepresent A-linear derivations into connective modules, with base change, colimit, transitivity and idempotent-vanishing properties (ALRS Lemma A.1.1, p. 175, ALRS line 9427). Prove that for a descendable map A → A_0 of solid animated R-algebras with Čech conerve A^•, ∧^m_A L_{A/R} → Tot(∧^m_{A^•} L_{A^•/R}) is an equivalence for all m (ALRS Lemma A.1.2, p. 175, ALRS line 9435), and that for discrete A, L_{A/ℤ} is discrete with L_{A/ℤ}(*) = L_{A(*)/ℤ}, while for p-complete A, L_{A/ℤ_p} is p-complete and L_{A[1/p]/ℚ_p} = (lim_n L_{(A/p^n)/(ℤ/p^n)})[1/p] (ALRS Lemma A.1.3, p. 175, ALRS line 9462).

A proof route: For descent, the fibre sequence A^• ⊗_A L_A → L_{A^•} → L_{A^•/A} reduces to Tot(L_{A^•/A}) = 0, which holds because A is a retract of a finite partial totalization (EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E5:descent) and the augmented diagrams A^m → A^{•+m+1} are split; general m uses the length-m filtration.

*Needs:* required contract `solid-cotangent-complex`; EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E5:cotangent-export.1; EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E5:descent; DerivedModuleAlgebra §0.4.

**Checks.**

- L_{ℚ_p⟨T⟩/ℚ_p} = ℚ_p⟨T⟩·dT in degree 0 (ALRS Remark 2.6.6).
- For a †-rational localization A → A⟨f/g⟩_{≤1}, an idempotent map, the cotangent complex vanishes.
- L_{C_p/ℚ_p} ≅ gr¹B⁺_dR(C_p)[1] = C_p(1)[1] (ALRS line 3889), nonzero although C_p is perfectoid: perfectoid vanishing applies only between perfectoid rings.
- L_{A/A} = 0.

### 4.6 Deformation theory of Gelfand stacks

For a map f: Y → X of presheaves on affinoid Gelfand stacks define: f is nilcomplete if Y(A) = lim_n Y(τ_{≤n}A) relative to X for strictly totally disconnected A; infinitesimally cohesive if for every square-zero extension Ã_d → A with derivation d: A → M[1], M connective, Y(Ã_d) ≅ Y(A) ×_{Y(A ⊕ M[1])} Y(A) relative to X; f admits a cotangent complex if there is a locally eventually connective L_{Y/X} ∈ D^+(Y) with fib(Y(R ⊕ M) → Y(R) ×_{X(R)} X(R ⊕ M)) ≅ τ_{≥0}Hom_R(η^*L_{Y/X}, M) naturally; f is formally étale if L_{Y/X} = 0 and formally smooth if L_{Y/X} is the dual of a connective perfect complex; f admits a deformation theory if it has all three properties (ALRS Definition A.2.2, p. 177, ALRS line 9552). Prove that maps of affinoid Gelfand stacks admit a deformation theory (ALRS Example A.2.3, p. 178, ALRS line 9591), that de Rham stacks are nilcomplete, infinitesimally cohesive and have zero cotangent complex (ALRS Lemma A.2.4, p. 178, ALRS line 9595), and the stability properties with the transitivity fibre sequence f^*L_{Y/X} → L_{Z/X} → L_{Z/Y} (ALRS Lemma A.2.5, p. 178, ALRS line 9601).

*Needs:* §4.5; §2.3; §3.1; DerivedModuleAlgebra §0.5; DerivedModuleAlgebra §0.25.

The API has the following laws.

- For Z → Y → X with Y → X admitting a cotangent complex, Z → Y admits one if and only if Z → X does, with the fibre sequence f^*L_{Y/X} → L_{Z/X} → L_{Z/Y}.
- For GSpec(B) → GSpec(A), L is the solid cotangent complex L_{B/A} of 4.5.
- X^dR → GSpec(ℚ_p) admits a deformation theory with L = 0.
- If f is infinitesimally cohesive with cotangent complex, square-zero extensions of Y over X with ideal M are τ_{≥0}Hom(L_{Y/X}, M[1]).

**Checks.**

- L_{A¹} = O·dT, so A¹ is formally smooth.
- For the zero section 0 → A¹, L = (T)/(T²)[1] = ℚ_p[1], whose dual ℚ_p[−1] is not connective; the map is not formally smooth, but it has perfect amplitude [−1, 0] (quasi-syntomic).
- L_{(A¹)^dR} = 0, consistent with (A¹)^dR = A¹/G_a^†: in the transitivity sequence of the G_a^†-torsor A¹ → (A¹)^dR, the term L_{A¹} = O·dT maps isomorphically onto the relative cotangent complex O, the dual of Lie(G_a^†) = ℚ_p.

### 4.7 The †-quasi-pro-étale topology and descent of deformation theory

Call A → B a †-quasi-pro-étale map of Gelfand rings if Marc(B) → Marc(A) is quasi-pro-étale and GSpec(B) → GSpec(A) is †-formally étale, with covers the finite jointly surjective families (ALRS Definition A.2.17, p. 184, ALRS line 9917). Prove that †-rational localizations and Berkovich-étale maps are †-quasi-pro-étale (ALRS Remark A.2.18, p. 184, ALRS line 9921), the stability properties of ALRS Lemma A.2.19, p. 184, ALRS line 9939, and that over a strictly totally disconnected A every †-quasi-pro-étale A → B is a filtered colimit of finite étale A-algebras, hence flat (ALRS Lemma A.2.20, p. 186, ALRS line 10024). For a topology τ of !-covers satisfying the flatness and formal smoothness conditions of ALRS §A.2, prove that nilcompleteness, infinitesimal cohesiveness and existence of cotangent complexes descend along epimorphisms that are infinitesimally cohesive and formally smooth, and along τ-covers of the target (ALRS Proposition A.2.15, p. 182, ALRS line 9833; ALRS Lemma A.2.11, p. 180, ALRS line 9732).

A proof route: Lemma A.2.20: over strictly totally disconnected A, GSpec(B) = GSpec(A) ×_{M(A)^Betti} M(B)^Betti and M(B) → M(A) is a countable limit of finite disjoint unions of clopens. For Proposition A.2.15 lift points along the epimorphism using formal smoothness, and identify the cotangent complex by the transitivity sequence.

*Needs:* §4.6; §4.2; §2.4; MotivesAndAlgebraicCyclesPartII §BM.0.

**Checks.**

- A †-rational localization is †-quasi-pro-étale but not finite étale.
- For A = C(S, C_p) with S light profinite and a clopen decomposition S = S_1 ⊔ S_2, A → C(S_1, C_p) is †-quasi-pro-étale and flat.

### 4.8 Tangent complexes and classifying stacks

For an infinitesimally cohesive map f: Y → X with cotangent complex define its tangent complex T_f (and shifts T_f[1]) as the spectrum-valued functor (R, η, M) ↦ fib(Y(R ⊕ M) → Y(R) ×_{X(R)} X(R ⊕ M)) (ALRS Construction A.3.1, p. 186, ALRS line 10041), and the overconvergent shifted twisted tangent complex (T_X[1]{1})^† as the fibre of T_X[1]{1} → its de Rham stack (ALRS Remark 3.1.4, p. 43, ALRS line 2230). Prove that for a map Y → X of arc-stacks weakly representable in arc-diamonds, Ŷ → X̂ is infinitesimally cohesive with zero cotangent complex (ALRS Lemma A.3.4, p. 187, ALRS line 10104); that for a group G → S admitting a deformation theory and formally smooth, with BG → S admitting a deformation theory, L_{BG/S} ≅ e^*L_f[−1] is the shifted adjoint representation on the cotangent complex at the unit (ALRS Proposition A.3.5, p. 188, ALRS line 10123); and that for a partially proper rigid analytic group G over a Banach field K, BG and BG^† (G^† the overconvergent neighbourhood of 1) admit a deformation theory over GSpec(K), with GSpec(K) → BG^{dR/K} and BG^† → BG epimorphisms for the †-quasi-pro-étale topology (ALRS Lemma A.3.6, p. 190, ALRS line 10234).

*Needs:* §4.6; §4.7; §2.8; §3.4.

**Checks.**

- L_{BG_m} = O[−1], the dual of the one-dimensional adjoint representation shifted by −1.
- L_{BG_a^†} = O[−1], although G_a^† has trivial underlying arc-stack.
- For the trivial group, BG = S and L_{BG/S} = 0.
- For a perfectoid space Y over a perfectoid X, L_{Ŷ/X̂} = 0, whereas L_{C_p/ℚ_p} ≠ 0 since ℚ_p is not perfectoid (compare 4.5).

### Examples

The closed point 0 → A¹ is a Zariski closed immersion with cotangent complex ℚ_p[1], quasi-syntomic but not formally smooth. The pushout of two closed discs along their origins is the node GSpec(ℚ_p⟨S, T⟩/(ST)). Berkovich spaces, de Rham stacks and Perf(−) are †-cohesive. L_{BG_m} = O[−1].

## Layer 5: The cone construction and the filtered de Rham stack

This layer introduces the cone of a Gelfand stack over A¹/G_m, a Gelfand incarnation of the deformation to the normal bundle, with its overconvergent, formal and special fibres; identifies its special fibre with the shifted twisted tangent bundle and, relative to a Cartier divisor, with the obstruction to lifting to the first infinitesimal neighbourhood; computes sheaves on formal cones of formally smooth maps as modules over the de Rham complex; and relates the filtered de Rham stack to the cone and to degree-one divisors on thickened affine lines, the toy model of the twistor stack.

### 5.1 Cones, overconvergent and formal cones, special fibres

For a Gelfand stack Y define its cone Y^cone → A¹/G_m as the functor sending a Gelfand stack Z with a Cartier divisor D ⊆ Z to Y(D), its overconvergent cone Y^{†-cone} = Y^cone ×_{A¹/G_m} A^{1,†}/G_m, its formal cone Y^{cone^} = Y^cone ×_{A¹/G_m} Â¹/G_m and its special fibre Y^cone_s = Y^cone ×_{A¹/G_m} BG_m; for f: Y → X define the relative cone Y^{cone/X} = Y^cone ×_{X^cone} (X × A¹/G_m) (ALRS Definition 2.8.1, p. 30, ALRS line 1598). Prove that Y^cone is a Gelfand stack (ALRS Lemma 2.8.2, p. 30, ALRS line 1609), that it is g_* f^* for f: BG_m → GSpec(ℚ_p) and g: BG_m → A¹/G_m and so commutes with limits (ALRS Remark 2.8.4, p. 30, ALRS line 1621), that there is a natural map Y^cone_s → Y × BG_m induced by R ⊕ I[1] → R (ALRS Remark 2.8.3, p. 30, ALRS line 1618), that Y^{cone/X} ×_{A¹/G_m} G_m/G_m ≅ X and, when f admits a cotangent complex, Y^{cone/X}_s ≅ T_{Y/X}[1](−1) over Y × BG_m, with G_m acting through t ↦ t^{-1} (ALRS Lemma 2.8.6, p. 31, ALRS line 1653), and that for †-formally étale Y → X the squares relating Y^{†-cone}, X^{†-cone}, their de Rham stacks and Y^dR, X^dR are cartesian, likewise for formal cones (ALRS Lemma 2.8.7, p. 31, ALRS line 1677). For a Cartier divisor D → W and Y → D define the relative cone Y^{cone/(D,W)} = Y^cone ×_{D^cone} W along the natural map W → D^cone (ALRS Definition 2.8.9, p. 32, ALRS line 1700).

A proof route: Well-definedness: !-equivalences are stable under base change, so the divisor Z(S) → GSpec(R/I) of a !-equivalence S → GSpec(R) over A¹/G_m is a !-equivalence. Over G_m/G_m the divisor is empty and Y(∅) is a point; over BG_m the divisor is the trivial square-zero extension R ⊕ I[1] and Y(R ⊕ I[1]) relative to Y(R) is τ_{≥0}Hom(η^*L_{Y/X}, I[1]).

*Needs:* §3.6; §4.6; §4.8; §4.1; SchemeAndStackFoundations §5.5.

The API has the following laws.

- Y ↦ Y^cone commutes with all limits of Gelfand stacks.
- The restriction of Y^{cone/X} to G_m/G_m is X.
- If f admits a cotangent complex, Y^{cone/X}_s ≅ T_{Y/X}[1] ⊗_{G_a} G_a(−1) over Y × BG_m.
- The natural map W → D^cone over A¹/G_m sends Z → W to Z ×_W D → D; relative cones over (D, W) are functorial in Y → D.
- For a Zariski closed immersion Z → X of Berkovich spaces, Z^{cone/X} is the analytification of the deformation to the normal bundle (SchemeAndStackFoundations §5.5, adic filtration of O_X → O_Z).

**Checks.**

- GSpec(ℚ_p)^cone = A¹/G_m and ∅^cone = G_m/G_m, since Y(R/I) = Y(0) is a point when I = R and empty otherwise for Y = ∅.
- G_a^cone = G_{a,A¹/G_m}/G_a(−1), where G_a(−1) is the geometric vector bundle of the ideal I → R (ALRS Example 2.8.5(1)).
- For Y = A¹ over GSpec(ℚ_p), the special fibre is T_{A¹}[1](−1) = BG_a(−1) over A¹ × BG_m.
- The weight convention is t ↦ t^{-1} on the tangent direction: with weight +1 the special fibre of A¹ would be BG_a(1), which is not the classifying stack of the ideal sheaf I of the universal divisor (3.6).

### 5.2 Square-zero lifts and the special fibre of the relative cone

For Y → X with cotangent complex and locally eventually connective M define the anima of square-zero extensions Sqz(Y/X; M) = τ_{≥0}Hom_Y(L_{Y/X}, M[1]) and, for Y → X → S and η ∈ Sqz(X/S; M), the anima of square-zero lifts Sqz(Y/S; η) (ALRS Definition 2.8.11, p. 32, ALRS line 1712); the divisor BG_m → A¹/G_m carries the square-zero extension ℚ_p[t]/t², so every Cartier divisor D → W has its first infinitesimal neighbourhood D(1) (ALRS Example 2.8.12, p. 32, ALRS line 1724). For Berkovich spaces construct the underlying square-zero thickening of η, compatible with base change and †-formally étale maps (ALRS Lemma 2.8.13, p. 33, ALRS line 1762; ALRS Lemma 2.8.14, p. 33, ALRS line 1777). Prove: for a Cartier divisor D → W over S and Y → D, Y^{cone/(D,W)} → W is an isomorphism off D; if Y → D → W → S are infinitesimally cohesive with cotangent complexes, Y^{cone/(D,W)}_s = D ×_{T_{D/S}[1](−1)} T_{Y/S}[1](−1) along the map classifying L_{D/S} → L_{D/W}; Y^{cone/(D,W)}_s → Y is a principal homogeneous space for T_{Y/D}[1] ⊗ N*_{D/W}, whose sections over †-formally étale U → Y are the square-zero lifts of U from D to D(1) (ALRS Proposition 2.8.15, p. 34, ALRS line 1805).

A proof route: Part (1) is Lemma 2.8.6(1) since W ∖ D = W ×_{A¹/G_m} G_m/G_m. Part (2) follows from the definitions and the description of D → D(1) → W; the torsor structure comes from the fibre sequence T_{Y/D}[1](−1) → T_{Y/S}[1](−1) → f^*T_{D/S}[1](−1); sections over †-étale U use Lemma 2.8.7.

*Needs:* §5.1; §4.6; §4.8; DerivedModuleAlgebra §0.25.

**Checks.**

- For X = GSpec(ℚ_p), M = ℚ_p, Sqz(X/X; ℚ_p) is a point (L = 0) and the unique extension is ℚ_p[ε]/ε².
- For the trivial divisor D × 0 → D × A¹, sections of the special fibre of X^{cone/D} always exist (the trivial deformation to D × GSpec(ℚ_p[t]/t²)), whereas for the divisor GSpec(C_p) → Spf B⁺_dR sections correspond to lifts to B⁺_dR/ξ², which need not exist (ALRS Remark 2.8.16).
- For Y = D the principal homogeneous space is trivial since T_{D/D} = 0, and its canonical section corresponds to D(1) itself.

### 5.3 Sheaves on formal cones and the de Rham complex

Use the realization of algebraic stacks as analytic stacks, under which sheaves on BG_m^alg, A^{1,alg}/G_m^alg and Â¹/G_m^alg over an analytic stack are graded, filtered and complete filtered modules, and Â¹/G_m^alg = BG_a[−1]/G_m^alg with the Beilinson t-structure (ALRS Remark 2.9.1, p. 35, ALRS line 1866; ALRS Remark 2.9.2, p. 36, ALRS line 1900). Prove that for a formally smooth map f: Y → X of Berkovich spaces with Ω¹_{Y/X} = L_{Y/X} a vector bundle, the map h: Y^{cone^/X} → |Y|^Betti × Â¹/G_m^alg is prim, so Mod_{h_*1}(D(|Y|^Betti × Â¹/G_m^alg)) → D(Y^{cone^/X}) is fully faithful; that the underlying graded algebra of h_*1 is ⊕_i ∧^i Ω^i_{Y/X}[−i](i); and that if f factors through a formally étale Y → A^n_X then, after shearing, h_*1 ≅ (Ω^•_{A^n/ℚ_p}, d) ⊗ O_Y (ALRS Proposition 2.9.3, p. 36, ALRS line 1914). Prove that for a smooth rigid space X over a Banach field K which is a Berkovich space, h_*1 lies in the heart of the Beilinson t-structure and is, after shearing, the de Rham complex (Ω^•_{X/K}, d) as a commutative differential graded algebra, so that filtered flat connections with Griffiths transversality embed fully faithfully into D(X^{cone^/K}) (ALRS Corollary 2.9.4, p. 38, ALRS line 2010; ALRS Example 2.9.5, p. 38, ALRS line 2021). Prove the relative version over a Cartier divisor D ⊆ W with W complete along D and a lift X̃ → W of a formally smooth X → D: X^{cone^/(D,W)} → |X|^Betti × W is prim, and for X̃ formally étale over A^n_W and D static, h_*1 is the D-de Rham complex O → Ω¹(D) → Ω²(2D) → ⋯ (ALRS Proposition 2.9.9, p. 40, ALRS line 2119).

A proof route: Primness is checked on special fibres, factoring Y/(T_{Y/X} ⋊ G_m) → Y/G_m → |Y|^Betti/G_m → |Y|^Betti/G_m^alg: the first is prim by Cartier duality for analytic vector bundles (RC26a Proposition 3.2.27 and Theorem 3.2.37, through the contract), the second by 2.7, the third because 1 is a direct summand of g_♯1 for GSpec(ℚ_p) → BG_m, using D(BG_m) ≅ modules over the algebra of sequences of RJRC Proposition 4.4.8. The graded algebra is computed by Cartier duality; the differential is identified on the closed polydisc and propagated by the universal property of the de Rham complex.

*Needs:* §5.1; §2.7; §4.8; required contract `algebraic-stacks-as-analytic`; required contract `analytic-cartier-duality`; required contract `analytic-stacks`.

**Checks.**

- For X = Y = GSpec(K), h_*1 = K in degree 0 and weight 0.
- For the open disc over ℚ_p, h_*1 is O → Ω¹ with Fil¹ = Ω¹[−1] and gr¹ = Ω¹[−1](1).
- Before shearing, h_*1 is the Hodge complex ⊕ Ω^i[−i](i) with zero differential as a graded algebra; the de Rham differential is extra structure visible only through the cdga structure, so identifying h_*1 with the graded algebra alone loses the connection.

### 5.4 The filtered de Rham stack and degree-one divisors on thickened affine lines

For a Gelfand stack X define the filtered de Rham stack X^{dR,+} → A¹/G_m as the sheafification of (I → R) ↦ X(R/(I ⊗_R Nil†(R))), with relative versions Y^{dR,+/X} and X^{dR,+/(D,W)} (ALRS Definition 3.1.1, p. 42, ALRS line 2195). Prove that for a †-cohesive map Y → X the square relating Y^{dR,+/X}, Y^{cone/X}, (Y × A¹/G_m)^dR and (Y^{cone/X})^dR is cartesian (ALRS Proposition 3.1.3, p. 42, ALRS line 2221), that over G_m/G_m the filtered de Rham stack is X^dR and, for X with a cotangent complex, over BG_m it is the Hodge stack, the classifying stack of the overconvergent shifted tangent bundle T^†_X[1](−1) (ALRS Remark 3.1.4, p. 43, ALRS line 2230). For a nilperfectoid A let Ã¹_A = A¹_{A^u} ⊔_{GSpec A^u} GSpec(A), a degree-one divisor on Ã¹_A being a Cartier divisor whose pullback to A¹_{A^u} is a section; define Div¹_{A¹} and X^{Div¹_{A¹}} (ALRS Definition 3.1.5, p. 43, ALRS line 2240). Prove the cartesian square (3.1.1) and Div¹_{A¹} ≅ A¹/G_m^†, and, for †-cohesive X, X^{Div¹_{A¹}} = X^{dR,+} ×_{A¹/G_m} A¹/G_m^† (ALRS §3.1, p. 43, ALRS line 2255).

A proof route: R/(I ⊗ Nil†R) is the pullback of R/I and R^{†-red} over R^{†-red}/(R^{†-red} ⊗ I), a pullback along a †-thickening and a surjection, so †-cohesiveness gives the square; a degree-one divisor D on Ã¹_A has D = GSpec(A/(I ⊗_A Nil†(A))).

*Needs:* §5.1; §4.4; §4.3; §3.1.

**Checks.**

- GSpec(ℚ_p)^{dR,+} = A¹/G_m, since the point takes value a point on every ring.
- Over G_m/G_m, (A¹)^{dR,+} restricts to (A¹)^dR = A¹/G_a^†.
- Vector bundles on A¹/G_m^† are vector bundles on A¹ with a T-connection whose operator T∂_T integrates (Remark 3.1.6); vector bundles on A¹/Ĝ_m are all T-connections, so A¹/Ĝ_m and A¹/G_m^† differ.
- Without †-cohesiveness the square of Proposition 3.1.3 need not be cartesian; the proof uses exactly the cohesive square for the †-thickening R/I → R^{†-red}/(R^{†-red} ⊗ I).

### Examples

The cone of GSpec(ℚ_p) is A¹/G_m; the cone of the empty stack is G_m/G_m. The cone of G_a is the quotient G_{a,A¹/G_m}/G_a(−1). For a smooth rigid X over a Banach field the pushforward of O from the formal cone is the de Rham complex with its Hodge filtration. Div¹_{A¹} ≅ A¹/G_m^†.

## Layer 6: Fargues–Fontaine discs and curves, Hyodo–Kato stacks

This layer realizes the relative Fargues–Fontaine disc and curve of a perfectoid space, and then of any arc-stack over 𝔽_p, as Gelfand stacks; fixes the radius normalization; defines Hyodo–Kato stacks as de Rham stacks of Fargues–Fontaine curves with their cohomological properties; and transports to the light Gelfand formalism the cohomological smoothness of relative Fargues–Fontaine curves and the dualizing complex of the curve over Marc(ℚ_p).

### 6.1 Fargues–Fontaine discs as Berkovich spaces and the radius map

For an affinoid perfectoid space S = Spa(A) of characteristic p, qfd and separable, with pseudo-uniformizer ϖ, define the relative Fargues–Fontaine disc D_{FF,S} = Spa(A_inf(A)) ∖ V([ϖ]) as the Berkovich space ⋃_s GSpec(B^†_{[0,s]}(S)), where A_inf(A) = W(A°) and B^†_{[0,s]} is the overconvergent rational localization of {|p|^s ≤ |[ϖ]| ≠ 0}, and the punctured disc D^×_{FF,S} = D_{FF,S} ∖ V(p) (ALRS §3.2, p. 44, ALRS line 2295). Construct its Frobenius φ_S and the radius map κ_ϖ: D_{FF,S} → [0, ∞)^Betti with κ_ϖ(x) = log|[ϖ]|_x / log|p|_x, so that κ_ϖ ∘ φ = p·κ_ϖ, κ_ϖ^{-1}(0) is the overconvergent neighbourhood of {p = 0} and κ_ϖ^{-1}((0,∞)) = D^×_{FF,S}; for S = T♭ with T perfectoid over ℚ_p fix the canonical radius κ by taking ϖ = p♭, which does not depend on the choice (ALRS Remark 3.2.1, p. 44, ALRS line 2322). Prove D^⋄_{FF,S} = S × Marc(ℤ_p) and D^{×,⋄}_{FF,S} = S × Marc(ℚ_p), that the constructions globalize to perfectoid spaces over 𝔽_p preserving Tate-analytic covers, and that every map of Gelfand stacks X → D^×_{FF,Y} from a perfectoid space X over ℚ_p extends uniquely to a φ-equivariant map D^×_{FF,X♭} → D^×_{FF,Y} through the untilt (ALRS Lemma 3.2.2, p. 45, ALRS line 2336).

A proof route: The disc is glued from the overconvergent rational localizations of Spa(A_inf); its perfectoidization is computed on the classical adic space (RelativeFarguesFontaine §2.2, diamondFormulaAndMapToBase). Lemma 3.2.2 follows from D^{×,⋄}_{FF,Y} = Y × Marc(ℚ_p) and X̂^⋄ = X for perfectoid X.

*Needs:* RelativeFarguesFontaine §2.2; Mathlib `WittVector`; §2.6; §2.8; §1.6; PerfectoidSpaces §P1.16; PerfectoidSpaces §P1.27; RelativeFarguesFontaine §1.2; VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB−1; FarguesFontaineDiamonds §F2.

The API has the following laws.

- κ_ϖ(φ(x)) = p·κ_ϖ(x), and replacing ϖ by ϖ^m multiplies κ_ϖ by m.
- D^{×,⋄}_{FF,S} = S ×_{Marc(𝔽_p)} Marc(ℚ_p), compatibly with φ = φ_S × id.
- On analytic adic spaces, D^×_{FF,S} agrees with the period domain Y_S of VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB−1 (relative-annuli) and RelativeFarguesFontaine §1.2, and κ_ϖ with periodRadius of radiusFunctionAndRationalAnnuli.
- Maps X → D^×_{FF,Y} from a perfectoid X over ℚ_p factor uniquely as X → D^×_{FF,X♭} → D^×_{FF,Y} with the second map φ-equivariant (the analytic analogue of W(R) → A factoring through W(A)).

**Checks.**

- At the point of D^×_{FF,C♭} given by the untilt C, |[p♭]| = |p| = p^{-1}, so κ = 1 for the canonical radius; its Frobenius translates have radius p^n for n ∈ ℤ.
- The reciprocal convention log|p|/log|[ϖ]| would send Frobenius to multiplication by p^{-1} and κ^{-1}(0) to {[ϖ] = 0}, contradicting κ ∘ φ = p·κ and κ^{-1}(0) = {|p| = 0}.
- For S = Spa(C♭), D^×_{FF,S} is the punctured open disc Y_{(0,∞)} of C♭.
- For S = ∅ both discs are empty.

### 6.2 Relative Fargues–Fontaine discs and curves of arc-stacks

Prove that Marc(A) ↦ D^×_{FF,A} sends geometric realizations of arc-hypercovers of separable totally disconnected perfectoid rings over 𝔽_p to !-equivalences (ABLB Corollary 4.4.10, p. 50, ABLB line 2641), and deduce the left exact colimit-preserving relative punctured Fargues–Fontaine disc D^×_{FF,−}: ArcStk → GelfStk (ALRS (3.2.1), p. 45, ALRS line 2352). For an arc-stack X over 𝔽_p define the relative Fargues–Fontaine curve FF_X = D^×_{FF,X}/φ^ℤ, a Gelfand stack (ALRS Definition 3.2.6, p. 45, ALRS line 2390). Prove that the natural map \hat{FF^⋄_X} → FF_X is not an isomorphism unless X = ∅: for a perfectoid X it is the map from the quotient of the uniformly completed cyclotomic base change by ℤ_p^{×,cont} to the quotient of the uncompleted one by ℤ_p^{×,sm} (ALRS Remark 3.2.4, p. 45, ALRS line 2357), and that FF_{Marc(ℚ_p)} ≅ FF_{ℚ_p^cyc}/Γ^cont with Γ = Gal(ℚ_p^cyc/ℚ_p) (ALRS Example 3.2.7, p. 46, ALRS line 2394). The quasi-coherent theory of (3.2.1) is a light variant of the solid formalism D_{(0,∞)} of ALBM (ALRS Remark 3.2.5, p. 45, ALRS line 2385).

*Needs:* §6.1; §2.4; §3.4; RelativeFarguesFontaine §2.1; VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB−1.

The API has the following laws.

- D^×_{FF,−} preserves colimits and finite limits; FF_− preserves colimits.
- For a perfectoid S over 𝔽_p, FF_S is the Gelfand stack of the relative curve X_S = Y_S/φ^ℤ of VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB−1 and RelativeFarguesFontaine §2.1.
- FF_{Marc(ℚ_p)} ≅ FF_{ℚ_p^cyc}/Γ^cont, with Γ^cont = GSpec(C(Γ, ℚ_p)).

**Checks.**

- For X = Marc(C♭), FF_X is the Fargues–Fontaine curve of C♭.
- For X = Marc(ℚ_p^cyc,♭) the map \hat{FF^⋄_X} → FF_X is the map from a quotient by ℤ_p^{×,cont} to a quotient by ℤ_p^{×,sm}, not an isomorphism.
- For X = ∅ both sides are empty and the map is an isomorphism.

### 6.3 Hyodo–Kato stacks

For an arc-stack X over 𝔽_p define the open punctured curve Y^⋄_X = X ×_{Marc(𝔽_p)} Marc(ℚ_p), its de Rham stack Y^dR_X = (Y^⋄_X)^dR, the curve FF^⋄_X = Y^⋄_X/φ^ℤ and the Hyodo–Kato stack X^HK = (FF^⋄_X)^dR; for a Gelfand stack X put X^HK = (X^⋄)^HK (ABLB Definition 6.1.1, p. 94, ABLB line 4983; ABLB Definition 6.1.2, p. 94, ABLB line 4989). Let O(n) on Marc(𝔽_p)^HK ≅ GSpec(ℚ_p)/φ^ℤ be the line bundle of the isocrystal (ℚ_p, p^{-n}φ) (ABLB Definition 6.2.4, p. 99, ABLB line 5247). Prove: for a map f: Y → X of qfd arc-stacks over ℤ_p which is arc-locally lqfd, f^HK is !-able and cohomologically proper when f is proper; if f is smooth of pure relative dimension d, f^HK is cohomologically smooth with dualizing complex (O(1)[2])^{⊗d}, the d-th power of the Tate twist, and cohomologically étale when f is étale; similarly for f^{Y^dR} (ABLB Theorem 6.3.1, p. 102, ABLB line 5415); for proper smooth f between Berkovich spaces over ℚ_p, f^HK_* preserves perfect modules (ABLB Corollary 6.3.2, p. 103, ABLB line 5470). Prove that f^HK_*O = O ⊕ O(−1)[−1] for G_m → Marc(𝔽_p) (ABLB Lemma 6.2.5, p. 99, ABLB line 5250) and that Hyodo–Kato stacks carry a strong theory of first Chern classes in the sense of Zav Definition 5.2.8 (ABLB Lemma 6.2.9, p. 100, ABLB line 5303).

A proof route: !-ability and properness reduce to 3.3(1). Smoothness reduces, arc-locally on X (3.2) and analytically on Y (3.3(2)), to G_m over Marc(ℤ_p^cyc): the perfected multiplicative group is suave by the perfectoid disc case 3.3(3), the quotient by ℤ_p^sm is suave, and 1 → g_*1 is an equivalence by excision along Marc(ℚ_p^cyc) ⊂ Marc(ℤ_p^cyc) ⊃ Marc(𝔽_p). The dualizing complex follows from the strong theory of first Chern classes and Zav Theorem 5.7.7.

*Needs:* §3.2; §3.3; §6.2; VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB0; required contract `analytic-stacks`.

**Checks.**

- Marc(𝔽_p)^HK = GSpec(ℚ_p)/φ^ℤ and its vector bundles are isocrystals over ℚ_p; O(1) is (ℚ_p, p^{-1}φ), of slope −1.
- For G_m, H¹ = O(−1), the isocrystal (ℚ_p, pφ): Frobenius acts on dlog T by p, matching the convention φ(dlog t) = p·dlog t.
- For P¹ → Marc(𝔽_p), f^HK_*O = O ⊕ O(−1)[−2] and ω = O(1)[2], so the trace pairs H²(P¹) = O(−1) with O(1) to give O.
- With ω = O(−1)[2] the trace H²(P¹) ⊗ ω would land in O(−2) ≠ O, so the dualizing twist has slope −1 isocrystal O(1), not O(−1).

### 6.4 Cohomological smoothness of relative Fargues–Fontaine curves in the light Gelfand formalism

Transport to the light Gelfand formalism, through the comparison of !-functors of ABLB §4.4 (ALRS footnote 57, p. 164, ALRS line 8910), the following statements. (1) For a smooth morphism g: Y → X of analytic adic spaces over ℚ_p, FF_{Y^⋄} → FF_{X^⋄} is cohomologically smooth (ALBM Theorem 4.4.4, p. 36, ALBM line 1580); if g is equidimensional of dimension d, its dualizing complex is the Tate twist O ⊗ ℚ_p(d) placed in cohomological degree −2d (ALBM Theorem 4.4.6, p. 38, ALBM line 1654). (2) FF_{Marc(ℚ_p)} → GSpec(ℚ_p) is cohomologically smooth and proper, with dualizing complex the (φ, Γ)-module of the cyclotomic character in degree −2 (ALBM Theorem 4.5.1, p. 40, ALBM line 1753; ALBM Corollary 4.5.2, p. 44, ALBM line 1930). Here the Tate twist ℚ_p(1) is the slope-zero line bundle given by the cyclotomic character, not the degree-one bundle O(1) of 7.6.

A proof route: Follow ALBM §§4.4–4.5 in the light setting: étale maps are cohomologically smooth, smoothness descends, the relative torus over a geometric point is treated directly, and the dualizing complex is computed from the unit section of A^d; the !-functors of ALBM and of the light Gelfand formalism agree by ABLB §4.4 (Lemma 4.4.3, Proposition 4.4.7, Corollary 4.4.10). For (2), FF_{Marc(ℚ_p)} has fibres Spd ℚ_p/φ^ℤ over Marc(ℚ_p), and the dualizing complex is pinned down by the cohomology of rank one (φ, Γ)-modules.

*Needs:* §6.2; §2.4; §2.2; DiamondsAndVStacks §D6.4; VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB4; required contract `analytic-stacks`.

**Checks.**

- For g an étale map, d = 0 and the dualizing complex is O.
- On FF_{C♭} the Tate twist O ⊗ ℚ_p(1) has H⁰ = ℚ_p(1), one-dimensional, whereas O(1) has H⁰ = BC(O(1))(C) = B^{φ=p}_cris, infinite-dimensional; reading (d) as O(d) gives the wrong dualizing complex.
- For (2), Γ(FF_{Marc(ℚ_p)}, O) = RΓ(G_{ℚ_p}, ℚ_p) has dimensions 1, 2, 0 in degrees 0, 1, 2, and duality with ℚ_p(1)[2] pairs H⁰ with H²(ℚ_p(1)) = ℚ_p and H¹ with H¹(ℚ_p(1)), local Tate duality.

### Examples

For S = Spa(C♭) the disc D^×_{FF,S} is the punctured open disc Y_{(0,∞)} and FF_S is the Fargues–Fontaine curve of C♭ as a Gelfand stack. Marc(𝔽_p)^HK = GSpec(ℚ_p)/φ^ℤ, whose vector bundles are isocrystals over ℚ_p. For f: G_m → Marc(𝔽_p) one has f^HK_*O = O ⊕ O(−1)[−1].

## Layer 7: Rational δ-spaces and analytic δ-stacks

This layer defines rational δ-spaces, the analytic analogue of δ-rings, as Berkovich thickenings of punctured Fargues–Fontaine discs with a Frobenius; constructs the δ-space attached to a uniformly perfectoid ring, the analytic analogue of the Witt vectors; defines analytic δ-stacks and their realization as Gelfand stacks; relates perfect analytic δ-stacks to arc-stacks and Hyodo–Kato stacks; computes perfect complexes on thickened Fargues–Fontaine curves; and constructs locally analytic Banach–Colmez spaces.

### 7.1 Rational δ-spaces

A rational δ-space is a tuple (S, 𝒳, ι, φ_𝒳) with S a qfd perfectoid space of characteristic p, 𝒳 a Berkovich space with an endomorphism φ_𝒳, and ι: D^×_{FF,S} → 𝒳 a map of Berkovich spaces inducing an isomorphism of arc-stacks D^{×,⋄}_{FF,S} ≅ 𝒳^⋄ with φ_𝒳 ∘ ι ≅ ι ∘ φ (a property, since D^×_{FF,S} is locally the spectrum of a static Banach algebra). A morphism (S, 𝒳) → (S′, 𝒳′) is a map α: S → S′, a φ-equivariant map 𝒳 → 𝒳′ (a datum) and the commutative square with the map of discs induced by α (a property). A δ-space is perfect if φ_𝒳 is an automorphism; Spc^δ and PerfSpc^δ denote the categories (ALRS Definition 3.3.1, p. 46, ALRS line 2398). For a perfect δ-space the Frobenius acts totally discontinuously on |𝒳| and the thickened Fargues–Fontaine curve 𝒳/φ^ℤ is defined (ALRS Remark 3.3.2, p. 46, ALRS line 2417). Prove that S ↦ (S, D^×_{FF,S}) is an equivalence from perfectoid spaces of characteristic p onto the full subcategory Spc^{δ,cl} of classical δ-spaces, and that the inclusion has right adjoint (S, 𝒳) ↦ S (ALRS Example 3.3.4, p. 46, ALRS line 2429; ALRS Lemma 3.5.2, p. 51, ALRS line 2670).

*Needs:* §6.1; §2.6; §2.8.

The API has the following laws.

- The Frobenius φ_𝒳 together with φ_S is an endomorphism of δ-spaces, natural in morphisms.
- Perf ≅ Spc^{δ,cl}, and Hom((S, D^×_{FF,S}), (S′, 𝒳′)) = Hom(S, S′).
- For a perfect δ-space, 𝒳/φ^ℤ is a Berkovich space with |𝒳/φ^ℤ| = |𝒳|/φ^ℤ.

**Checks.**

- For S = Spa(C♭), (S, D^×_{FF,S}) is a perfect δ-space whose thickened curve is FF_{C♭}.
- For S = Marc(𝔽_p((π^{1/p^∞}))), the decompleted perfected punctured open disc D^{×,<1,perf}_{ℚ_p} with φ(x) = x^p is a perfect δ-space which is not a †-thickening of D^×_{FF,S} (ALRS Example 3.3.5).
- For 𝒳 = D^×_{FF,S} ⊔ D^×_{FF,S} with ι the first inclusion, ι^⋄ is not an isomorphism, so this is not a δ-space.
- For S = ∅ the only δ-space is (∅, ∅), since a Berkovich space with empty perfectoidization is empty.

### 7.2 The δ-space attached to a uniformly perfectoid ring

Let A be a uniformly perfectoid Gelfand ring, T = GSpec(A), T^u = GSpec(A^u), T♭ the tilt of T^u, f: T^u → D^×_{FF,T♭} the untilt and f_φ: ℕ × T^u → D^×_{FF,T♭} the map equal to φ^n ∘ f on {n} × T^u. Prove that the category of δ-spaces (S, 𝒳) with a map T → 𝒳 of Berkovich spaces has an initial object (T♭, 𝒳_T), where 𝒳_T is the pushout in Berkovich spaces of f_φ and ℕ × T^u → ℕ × T (ALRS Proposition 3.4.7, p. 48, ALRS line 2501; ALRS Definition 3.4.8, p. 48, ALRS line 2524). Prove the perfect analogue, with initial perfect δ-space D^×_{FF,A} = (ℤ × T) ⊔_{ℤ × T^u} D^×_{FF,T♭} and Fargues–Fontaine curve FF_A = D^×_{FF,A}/φ^ℤ (ALRS Remark 3.4.10, p. 48, ALRS line 2535); the radius map κ: 𝒳_T → (0, ∞) sends the n-th copy of T to p^n and κ^{-1}(p^n) = GSpec(A ×_{A^u} B^†_{[p^n,p^n],A^u}) (ALRS Remark 3.4.9, p. 48, ALRS line 2526). Prove that D^×_{FF,Marc(A^u)} → D^×_{FF,A} is an isomorphism if and only if A is perfectoid (ALRS Remark 3.4.17, p. 50, ALRS line 2634), and that 𝒳_T represents the maps W′(A_{≤1}) → B_{≤1} whose composite to every perfectoid B-algebra factors through D^×_{FF,A^u}, where W′(A_{≤1}) = W(A_{≤1}) ×_{W(A^{u,°})} W(A^{u,°,♭}) (ALRS Remark 1.5, p. 4, ALRS line 197).

A proof route: Given (S, 𝒳) and T → 𝒳, the composite T^u → 𝒳 is determined by T^{u,⋄} → 𝒳^⋄ = D^{×,⋄}_{FF,S} since T^u = \hat{T^{u,⋄}}, hence factors through D^×_{FF,S}; Lemma 3.2.2 (6.1) factors T^u → D^×_{FF,S} through f; extend φ-equivariantly to ℕ × T^u and ℕ × T, and conclude by the pushout of 4.3(2), whose input A → A^u is an isomorphism on uniform completions.

*Needs:* §7.1; §6.1; §4.3; PerfectoidSpaces §P1.27.

**Checks.**

- For A perfectoid, 𝒳_T = D^×_{FF,T♭}, since the pushout is along the identity of ℕ × T.
- For A = C_p[ε]/ε², 𝒳_T agrees with D^×_{FF,C♭} away from the radii p^n, n ≥ 0, and at radius p^n contains the thickened point GSpec(C_p[ε]/ε²).
- For A = ℚ_p(μ_{p^∞}) uncompleted, the map D^×_{FF,Marc(A^u)} → D^×_{FF,A} is not an isomorphism, since A is not perfectoid.
- For A = 0, 𝒳_T = ∅.

### 7.3 Analytic δ-stacks and their realization

Let (−)^preal: P(Spc^δ) → GelfStk be the colimit-preserving functor sending (S, 𝒳) to 𝒳; call a map of presheaves a !-equivalence if its realization is an isomorphism, and define the ∞-category AnStk^δ of rational analytic δ-stacks as the localization at !-equivalences, with induced colimit-preserving realization (−)^real: AnStk^δ → GelfStk; define PerfAnStk^δ likewise from perfect δ-spaces (ALRS Definition 3.4.2, p. 47, ALRS line 2470; ALRS Remark 3.4.4, p. 47, ALRS line 2482). Every analytic δ-stack has a Frobenius endomorphism, an automorphism in the perfect case, and realization is conservative (ALRS Remark 3.4.3, p. 47, ALRS line 2479; ALRS Remark 3.4.5, p. 47, ALRS line 2488). Prove that realization commutes with finite limits, hence is the inverse image of a geometric morphism, and that it sends 𝒴 to the !-sheafification of T = GSpec(A) ↦ 𝒴(T♭, 𝒳_T) on uniformly perfectoid A; in the perfect case to the sheafification of A ↦ 𝒴(Marc(A)♭, D^×_{FF,A}) (ALRS Proposition 3.4.12, p. 49, ALRS line 2569; ALRS Remark 3.4.13, p. 49, ALRS line 2586). Define admissible δ-stacks (realization needs no sheafification on nilperfectoids), prove that they are closed under limits and that for admissible 𝒴, (𝒴^perf)^real ≅ lim_φ 𝒴^real (ALRS Definition 3.4.15, p. 50, ALRS line 2614; ALRS Lemma 3.4.16, p. 50, ALRS line 2617); construct the perfection adjunction (ALRS Remark 3.4.14, p. 50, ALRS line 2599) and the δ-stacks T_{Spc^δ}: (S, 𝒳) ↦ T(𝒳) and T_{FF}: (S, 𝒳) ↦ T(𝒳/φ^ℤ) for a Gelfand stack T (ALRS Definition 3.4.18, p. 51, ALRS line 2651).

A proof route: Proposition 3.4.7 gives a partial left adjoint on uniformly perfectoid affinoids; the induced adjunction on presheaves expresses realization as the composite of the restriction Ψ′ with sheafification, and sheafification preserves colimits and finite limits.

*Needs:* §7.2; §2.1; §2.4; EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E2.7.

The API has the following laws.

- (−)^real preserves colimits and finite limits and is conservative.
- 𝒴^real is the !-sheafification of A ↦ 𝒴(T♭, 𝒳_T) on uniformly perfectoid A.
- Admissible (perfect) analytic δ-stacks are closed under limits, and for admissible 𝒴 the perfection is computed by lim_φ on realizations.
- The Frobenius of an analytic δ-stack is a natural endomorphism, inducing a Frobenius on its realization; T_{FF} has trivialized Frobenius.

**Checks.**

- The final analytic δ-stack realizes to GSpec(ℚ_p), since realization preserves finite limits.
- The δ-stack represented by (S, 𝒳) realizes to 𝒳.
- The presheaf T ↦ 𝒴(T♭, 𝒳_T) need not be a !-sheaf, because T ↦ 𝒳_T does not preserve fibre products even over a perfectoid base (ALRS footnote 24); sheafification is part of the definition.

### 7.4 Perfect analytic δ-stacks, arc-stacks and Hyodo–Kato stacks

Prove that (−)^⋄_FF: PerfAnStk^δ → ArcStk, 𝒴 ↦ (S ↦ 𝒴(S, D^×_{FF,S})), is well defined with a fully faithful left adjoint D^×_{FF,(−)}, the colimit-preserving extension of S ↦ D^×_{FF,S} which preserves finite limits, and a fully faithful right adjoint D^{×,dR}_{FF,(−)}: Y ↦ ((S, 𝒳) ↦ Y(S)) with admissible values (ALRS Proposition 3.5.3, p. 51, ALRS line 2685). Define the de Rham Fargues–Fontaine stack D^{×,dR}_{FF,Y} and 𝒴^dR = D^{×,dR}_{FF,𝒴^⋄_FF} (ALRS Definition 3.5.4, p. 52, ALRS line 2735). Prove that (D^{×,dR}_{FF,Y})^real = (Y × Marc(ℚ_p))^dR, so that Y^HK = D^{×,dR}_{FF,Y}/φ^ℤ realizes the Hyodo–Kato stack of 6.3 (ALRS Remark 3.5.6, p. 52, ALRS line 2743), that D^{×,dR}_{FF,(−)} commutes with colimits (ALRS Lemma 3.5.7, p. 53, ALRS line 2754), and that realization commutes with de Rham stacks, with D^×_{FF,𝒴^⋄} → 𝒴^real → (𝒴^dR)^real inducing equivalences on de Rham stacks, also for non-perfect analytic δ-stacks (ALRS Remark 3.5.8, p. 53, ALRS line 2764).

A proof route: From the adjunction of 7.1 (Lemma 3.5.2) one obtains j_! ⊣ j^* ⊣ j_* on presheaves; arc-covers of perfectoids induce !-covers of perfect δ-spaces and conversely, so j^* and j_* restrict; full faithfulness and finite limits follow as in ABLB Proposition 4.5.7, the finite-limit statement reducing to products of perfectoid spaces over 𝔽_p((π^{1/p^∞})) via Teichmüller coordinates; colimits follow from 3.2.

*Needs:* §7.3; §7.1; §6.3; §3.2.

**Checks.**

- For Y = Marc(𝔽_p), (D^{×,dR}_{FF,Y})^real = Marc(ℚ_p)^dR = GSpec(ℚ_p), so Y^HK = GSpec(ℚ_p)/φ^ℤ as in 6.3.
- D^×_{FF,Marc(K)×Marc(K)} = D_{FF,K} ×_{GSpec(ℚ_p)} D_{FF,K} for K = 𝔽_p((π^{1/p^∞})), the finite-limit compatibility.
- D^{×,dR}_{FF,(−)} is a right adjoint and preserves the final object: D^{×,dR}_{FF,Marc(𝔽_p)} is the final perfect analytic δ-stack, consistent with its realization GSpec(ℚ_p).

### 7.5 Perfect complexes on thickened Fargues–Fontaine curves

Define the sheaves of categories Perf^{[n,m]} on Gelfand stacks and Perf^{[n,m],FF} on perfect δ-spaces, (S, 𝒳) ↦ Perf^{[n,m]}(𝒳/φ^ℤ) (ALRS Definition 3.6.1, p. 53, ALRS line 2797). Prove that for a nilperfectoid (or uniformly perfectoid) A the square Perf(FF_A) → Perf(FF_{A^u}), Perf(GSpec A) → Perf(GSpec A^u) is cartesian; consequently A ↦ Perf(FF_A) is a sheaf of categories on Gelfand stacks and (Perf^≃_FF)^real = Perf^≃ ×_{Perf^{≃,dR}} (Perf^≃_FF)^{dR,real} (ALRS Proposition 3.6.3, p. 54, ALRS line 2822); the same holds for D^+ and fixed amplitudes (ALRS Remark 3.6.4, p. 54, ALRS line 2838), for Perf on perfect δ-spaces and on δ-spaces (ALRS Remark 3.6.7, p. 55, ALRS line 2857), and for global sections: Γ(FF_A, E) = Γ(FF_{A^u}, E) ×_{Γ(A^u, E)} Γ(A, E) (ALRS Corollary 3.6.5, p. 54, ALRS line 2841). For a strictly totally disconnected nilperfectoid A deduce Γ(GSpec A, O_{FF_A}) ≅ A ×_{A^u} ℚ_p^dR(A) = ℚ_p^la(A) (ALRS Example 3.6.6, p. 54, ALRS line 2847).

A proof route: Cover FF_A by †-rational localizations; on each, the pushout description of 7.2 and the Perf statement of 4.3(3) give the cartesian square; sheafiness of A ↦ Perf(FF_{A^u}) and Perf(A^u) on nilperfectoids is ABLB Proposition 4.4.7.

*Needs:* §7.2; §4.3; §2.3; §3.4; VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB1.

**Checks.**

- For A perfectoid both horizontal maps are identities and the square is trivially cartesian.
- For A = C_p[ε]/ε², Γ(FF_A, O) = ℚ_p ×_{C_p} (C_p[ε]/ε²) = ℚ_p ⊕ C_p·ε, using Γ(FF_{C♭}, O) = ℚ_p.
- The value of Example 3.6.6 at A = C_p[ε]/ε² agrees with the computation ℚ_p^la(C_p[ε]/ε²) = ℚ_p ⊕ C_p·ε of 3.4.

### 7.6 Locally analytic Banach–Colmez spaces

For λ ∈ ℚ let (D_λ, φ_{D_λ}) be the standard isocrystal of slope λ and, for a nilperfectoid A, O_{FF_A}(λ) the descent along D^×_{FF,A} → FF_A of O ⊗_{ℚ_p} D_{−λ}; define the absolute Banach–Colmez spaces BC(O(λ)): A ↦ Γ(FF_A, O(λ)) for λ ≥ 0 and BC(O(λ)[1]): A ↦ Γ(FF_A, O(λ)[1]) for λ < 0, and their incarnations BC_FF in PerfAnStk^δ with BC_FF(O(λ))^real = BC(O(λ)) (ALRS Definition 3.7.1, p. 55, ALRS line 2869; ALRS Remark 3.7.2, p. 55, ALRS line 2878). Prove 1 + D̃^{<1}_{ℚ_p} := lim_{x↦x^p}(1 + D^{<1}_{ℚ_p}) ≅ BC(O(1)) compatibly with the logarithm (ALRS Example 3.7.3, p. 55, ALRS line 2890), and: for λ ≥ 0, BC(O(λ)) = (G_a^an ⊗ D_{−λ}) ×_{G_a^{an,dR} ⊗ D_{−λ}} BC(O(λ))^dR, so BC(O) = ℚ_p^la and G_a^† ⊗ D_{−λ} → BC(O(λ)) → BC(O(λ))^dR is an extension of ℚ_p^la-modules; for λ < 0 the analogous square with B(G_a^dR ⊗ D_{−λ}) (ALRS Proposition 3.7.4, p. 56, ALRS line 2915); and BC_FF → BC_FF^dR is an epimorphism (ALRS Corollary 3.7.5, p. 56, ALRS line 2937). Prove that the de Rham stacks agree, after base change to Marc(ℚ_p), with the classical Banach–Colmez spaces BC of VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB3 (FS Proposition II.2.2, p. 60, FS line 2274).

A proof route: Apply 7.5 to E = O(λ) or O(λ)[1]: the lower-left term is G_a^an ⊗ D_{−λ} (resp. its classifying stack) by definition of O(λ), the right column is the de Rham stack of the left, and the upper right is the classical Banach–Colmez space (FS Proposition II.2.2, VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB3 lubin-tate-universal-cover). For λ = 1 the map 1 + D̃^{<1} → BC(O(1)) is an isomorphism because log: 1 + D^{<1} → A¹ is étale of partially proper rigid spaces and 1 + D̃^{<1} → 1 + D^{<1} is †-formally étale.

*Needs:* §7.5; §7.3; §3.4; §4.1; VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB0; VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB1; VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB3.

**Checks.**

- BC(O) = ℚ_p^la and BC(O)^dR = ℚ_p^sm; the kernel of BC(O)(A) → BC(O)^dR(A) is Nil†(A), which is ℚ_p·ε for A = ℚ_p[ε]/ε².
- BC(O(1))(C_p) = 1 + 𝔪_{C_p♭} as a group under multiplication, and its image under the logarithm of the first coordinate lands in C_p.
- For λ = −1, BC(O(−1)[1])^dR(C_p) = H¹(FF_{C♭}, O(−1)) = C_p/ℚ_p (FS Proposition II.2.5).
- Using D_λ instead of D_{−λ} would give O(1) the slope −1, with H⁰(FF_{C♭}, O(1)) = 0, contradicting BC(O(1)) = 1 + D̃^{<1}.

### Examples

The classical δ-space (S, D^×_{FF,S}); the cyclotomic δ-space (Marc(𝔽_p((t^{1/p^∞}))), (lim_{x↦x^p} 1 + D^{<1})∖{1}), which is not a †-thickening; X_T for T = GSpec(C_p[ε]/ε²), thickened at the points of radius p^n; BC(O) = ℚ_p^la and BC(O(1)) = 1 + D̃^{<1}.

## Layer 8: The rational analytic prismatization and the p-adic twistor stack

This layer defines degree-one Cartier divisors on δ-spaces, rational analytic prisms, the prismatic site, the prismatization X^Δ of a Gelfand stack, its perfect version X^{Div¹~} = lim_φ X^Δ, the p-adic twistor stack X^{Div¹} = X^{Div¹~}/φ^ℤ and the analytic Hodge–Tate stack X^HT; computes their de Rham stacks; describes X^Δ through the cone of X and the Breuil–Kisin divisor; decomposes X^Δ by the radius map into a Hyodo–Kato part and a twistor part; and proves descent along †-formally étale and quasi-syntomic maps.

### 8.1 Degree-one divisors, rational analytic prisms and the prismatic site

For a δ-space (S, 𝒳) call a Cartier divisor (s: L → O_𝒳) of degree one if its pullback to D^×_{FF,S} represents the closed Cartier divisor S^♯ → D^×_{FF,S} of an untilt S^♯ of S (FS Proposition II.1.18, p. 55, FS line 2105). A rational analytic prism (S, 𝒳, D) is a δ-space with a degree-one divisor D ⊆ 𝒳 (the map D → 𝒳 need not be a monomorphism). For a Gelfand stack X the rational analytic prismatic site X_{Δ-site} consists of tuples (S, 𝒳, D, α: D → X), with coverings induced by !-covers of (S, 𝒳); Q_{p,Δ} is the analytic δ-stack of degree-one divisors and X_Δ → Q_{p,Δ} the analytic δ-stack (S, 𝒳, D) ↦ Map(D, X) (ALRS Definition 4.1.1(1)–(4), p. 57, ALRS line 2953). Prove rigidity: for a morphism of prisms (S′, 𝒳′, D′) → (S, 𝒳, D), D′ → D ×_𝒳 𝒳′ is an isomorphism (ALRS Remark 4.1.2(3), p. 57, ALRS line 2988).

A proof route: Rigidity reduces to an isomorphism of invertible ideal sheaves, which can be checked after uniform completion, where it is rigidity of degree-one divisors on D^×_{FF,S′} (FarguesFontaineDiamonds §F4, untilt_closed_divisor; RelativeFarguesFontaine §3.2).

*Needs:* RelativeFarguesFontaine §4.7; §7.1; §3.6; §6.1; RelativeFarguesFontaine §3.2; FarguesFontaineDiamonds §F4; VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB−1.

The API has the following laws.

- The pullback of a degree-one divisor along a morphism of δ-spaces is of degree one, giving the δ-stack Q_{p,Δ}.
- For a morphism of prisms, D′ ≅ D ×_𝒳 𝒳′.
- On the classical δ-space (S, D^×_{FF,S}), degree-one divisors are the untilt divisors of RelativeFarguesFontaine §3.2 and FarguesFontaineDiamonds §F4.

**Checks.**

- On X_cyc = (lim_{x↦x^p} 1 + D^{<1}_{ℚ_p}) ∖ {1}, the divisor of [p]_q = (q^p − 1)/(q − 1) has degree one, with D = GSpec(ℚ_p(μ_{p^∞})) uncompleted (ALRS Example 4.1.7(1)).
- On X_cyc the divisor of q − 1 is empty, since q = 1 is excluded from X_cyc, so it is not of degree one.
- The divisor of [p]_q² pulls back to twice an untilt divisor and is not of degree one.
- On lim_{x↦x^p} D^{<1}_{ℚ_p} ∖ {0} with φ(X) = X^p, the divisor of X − p has degree one, with D = GSpec(ℚ_p(p^{1/p^∞})) (ALRS Example 4.1.7(2)).

### 8.2 The prismatization, the p-adic twistor stack and the Hodge–Tate stack

For a Gelfand stack X define the rational analytic prismatization X^Δ as the realization of X_Δ, equivalently the sheafification of the functor sending a nilperfectoid A over Q_p^Δ = GSpec(ℚ_p)^Δ to Map(D, X), D ⊆ 𝒳_{GSpec A} the classified degree-one divisor; the rational perfect analytic prismatization X^{Div¹~} = lim_φ X^Δ; and the p-adic twistor stack X^{Div¹} = X^{Div¹~}/φ^ℤ, with Div¹~ = (Q_p^Δ)^{Div¹~} and Div¹ = Div¹~/φ (ALRS Definition 4.1.1(5)–(7), p. 57, ALRS line 2965). Construct the natural map X^Δ → A¹/G_m from the divisor {0} × T ⊂ ℕ × T → 𝒳_T and the analytic Hodge–Tate stack X^HT = X^Δ ×_{A¹/G_m} BG_m (ALRS Definition 4.1.4, p. 58, ALRS line 3010). Prove that X ↦ X_Δ is right adjoint to the colimit-preserving functor (S, 𝒳, D) ↦ D and commutes with fibre products (ALRS Remark 4.1.2(2), p. 57, ALRS line 2980), that the perfect prismatic site gives a perfect δ-stack with (X^{Div¹~})^real → X^{Div¹~} an equivalence for †-cohesive X (ALRS Remark 4.1.2(4), p. 57, ALRS line 2993), and construct the maps 𝒳 → D^Δ → Q_p^Δ attached to a prism (ALRS Remark 4.1.6, p. 58, ALRS line 3017) and the relative prismatization Y^{Δ/𝒳} = Y^Δ ×_{D^Δ} 𝒳 and relative Hodge–Tate stack Y^{HT/D} = Y^{Δ/𝒳} ×_𝒳 D over a prism (ALRS Definition 4.1.8, p. 59, ALRS line 3048).

*Needs:* §8.1; §7.3; §7.2; §3.6; §4.4.

The API has the following laws.

- (X ×_Z Y)^Δ = X^Δ ×_{Z^Δ} Y^Δ, and likewise for X^{Div¹~}, X^{Div¹} and X^HT.
- X^Δ carries a Frobenius φ over the Frobenius of Q_p^Δ; X^{Div¹~} is its perfection and X^{Div¹} the quotient by φ^ℤ.
- The map X^Δ → A¹/G_m is the pullback of the classified divisor along {0} × T → 𝒳_T; the resulting divisor X^HT ⊆ X^Δ is the Hodge–Tate divisor.
- A prism (S, 𝒳, D) gives maps 𝒳 → D^Δ → Q_p^Δ sending D to D^HT → Q_p^HT.

**Checks.**

- ∅^Δ = ∅ and GSpec(ℚ_p)^Δ = Q_p^Δ.
- The cyclotomic prism gives a cartesian square GSpec(ℚ_p(μ_{p^∞})) = X_cyc ×_{Q_p^Δ} Q_p^HT (ALRS Example 4.1.7(1)).
- The map {0} × T → 𝒳_T is not itself a Cartier divisor; for D ∈ Q_p^HT(A) the map T → D is a derived thickening with fibre sequence Nil†(A)[1] → O_D → A (ALRS Remark 4.1.5), so X^HT must be defined through A¹/G_m.

### 8.3 de Rham stacks of the prismatization, perfectoids and étale descent

Prove that (X_Δ)^⋄_FF = X^⋄, so that X^dR_Δ = D^{×,dR}_{FF,X^⋄} over Q^dR_{p,Δ} (ALRS Lemma 4.2.1, p. 59, ALRS line 3062), giving maps D^×_{FF,X^⋄} → X^Δ → D^{×,dR}_{FF,X^⋄} inducing equivalences on de Rham stacks (ALRS Remark 4.2.2, p. 59, ALRS line 3069); that X^{Div¹~,dR} → X^{Δ,dR} and colim_φ X^Δ → X^{Δ,dR} are isomorphisms and X^{Div¹~,dR} ≅ D^{×,dR}_{FF,X^⋄} (ALRS Proposition 4.2.3, p. 59, ALRS line 3080); that for a perfectoid space Y over ℚ_p the map π_Y: Y^HT → Y, sending a point (D, T → D → FF_A, D → Y) to the composite T → D → Y, is an isomorphism (ALRS Proposition 4.2.4, p. 59, ALRS line 3094); and that for a †-formally étale X′ → X, X′^Δ = X^Δ ×_{D^{×,dR}_{FF,X^⋄}} D^{×,dR}_{FF,X′^⋄}, so X ↦ X^Δ satisfies descent for †-formally étale hypercovers (ALRS Lemma 4.2.5, p. 60, ALRS line 3118).

A proof route: For Proposition 4.2.3 note that for each degree-one divisor D ⊆ 𝒳_T some Frobenius pullback lands in 𝒳_T ∖ (ℕ × T) ≅ D^×_{FF,T♭} ∖ (ℕ × T^u). For Proposition 4.2.4 build the inverse Y → Y^HT from FF_A → FF_Y and the divisor Y ×_{FF_Y} FF_A, and use rigidity (8.1). For Lemma 4.2.5 use †-formal étaleness against the †-reduction of D and arc-hyperdescent of D^{×,dR}_{FF,(−)} (7.4).

*Needs:* §8.2; §7.4; §4.1; §3.2; §8.1.

**Checks.**

- For Y = GSpec(C_p), Y^HT = GSpec(C_p).
- For a perfectoid Y over ℚ_p, Y^{Div¹} and FF_Y are not isomorphic (ALRS line 3114), in contrast with the p-complete prismatization of perfectoids.
- GSpec(ℚ_p[ε]/ε²) and GSpec(ℚ_p) have the same de Rham stack of the prismatization, D^{×,dR}_{FF,Marc(ℚ_p)}, although their prismatizations differ.

### 8.4 The Breuil–Kisin divisor and the cone description

Let I_Δ be the ideal sheaf of the Hodge–Tate locus and define the Breuil–Kisin ideal I_BK = ⊗_{n∈ℕ} (φ^n)^* I_Δ, a line bundle on Q_p^Δ (the product is locally finite, since locally all but finitely many factors are trivial), with Breuil–Kisin divisor μ_BK: Q_p^Δ → A¹/G_m (ALRS Definition 4.2.7, p. 61, ALRS line 3166; ALRS Remark 4.2.8, p. 61, ALRS line 3175). Prove that the pullback of μ_BK along 𝒳_T → Q_p^Δ is D_BK = ⊔_{n∈ℕ} φ^{n,*}D, the Frobenius translates being disjoint (ALRS Lemma 4.2.10, p. 62, ALRS line 3217). Prove that for †-cohesive X, X^Δ is admissible and the diagram (4.2.2) is cartesian (ALRS Lemma 4.2.6, p. 61, ALRS line 3154), and that the square with corners X^Δ, D^{×,dR}_{FF,X^⋄}, X^cone, (X^cone)^dR, through μ_BK: X^Δ → X^cone ×_{A¹/G_m, μ_BK} Q_p^Δ, is cartesian, so that μ_BK is †-formally étale (ALRS Proposition 4.2.11, p. 62, ALRS line 3250).

A proof route: The pushout 𝒳_T = D^×_{FF,A^u} ⊔_{ℕ × T^u} (ℕ × T) induces a pushout D = D̄ ⊔_{D_BK ×_{𝒳_T} T^u} (D_BK ×_{𝒳_T} T) of divisors, with D̄ the reduction; †-cohesiveness of X turns it into the cartesian square of anima, which is the value of the claimed square at A.

*Needs:* §8.3; §5.1; §4.4; §4.3; §6.1.

**Checks.**

- On X_cyc, μ_BK pulls back to the ideal generated by log(q)/(q − 1): log(q) has simple zeros at all p-power roots of unity, and dividing by q − 1 removes q = 1, leaving the zeros of [p]_{q^{p^n}}, n ≥ 0 (ALRS Proposition 4.8.1(3)).
- The translates φ^{n,*}D and φ^{m,*}D for n ≠ m have disjoint supports because the radius map multiplies by p under Frobenius (6.1).
- On Q_p^Δ only the pullbacks φ^{n,*} with n ≥ 0 exist, because φ is not invertible on the δ-spaces 𝒳_T; the ℤ-indexed product ⊗_{n∈ℤ} φ^n(I_Δ) exists only on the perfection Div¹~, where it is the perfected twist of 9.8.
- Over the open complement Q_p^Δ ∖ ⋃_n φ^{-n}(Q_p^HT) the Breuil–Kisin ideal is trivial.

### 8.5 The radius map and the Hyodo–Kato and twistor regions

Construct the radius map κ: X^Δ → (0, ∞) through X^Δ → (D^×_{FF,X^⋄})^dR (ALRS Remark 4.2.12, p. 63, ALRS line 3287). Prove that for †-cohesive X: (1) X^Δ → (D^×_{FF,X^⋄})^dR is an isomorphism over (1, ∞), so φ induces X^Δ_{(1,∞)} ≅ X^Δ_{(p,∞)} with coequalizer X^HK; (2) X^{Div¹~} → X^Δ is an isomorphism over (0, p), so φ induces X^Δ_{(0,1)} ≅ X^Δ_{(0,p)} with coequalizer X^{Div¹} (ALRS Proposition 4.2.13, p. 63, ALRS line 3309); and X^Δ ≅ X^{Div¹~}_{(0,p)} ⊔_{X^{Div¹~}_{(1,p)}} (D^{×,dR}_{FF,X^⋄})_{(1,∞)} (ALRS Corollary 4.2.14, p. 64, ALRS line 3362). The two radius functions are reciprocal: a divisor D ⊆ 𝒳_T lands in 𝒳_{T,(r,s)} if and only if the corresponding point of X^Δ lands in X^Δ_{(1/s,1/r)} (ALRS Proposition 4.2.13, proof, p. 64, ALRS line 3327).

A proof route: Compare the radius of 𝒳_T, which sends n × T to p^n, with the radius of X^Δ coming from Marc(ℚ_p) × Marc(ℚ_p): at an untilt K^♯ of K♭ the first uses the tilt of p and the second the tilt of a uniformizer of K^♯, whence the reciprocal relation; then use that 𝒳_T is classical over (0, 1/p) ∪ (1/p, ∞) up to Frobenius.

*Needs:* §8.4; §7.2; §6.3; §6.1.

**Checks.**

- The Hodge–Tate locus of X^Δ lies at κ = 1 and its n-th inverse Frobenius translate at κ = p^{-n}, whereas the n-th copy of T in 𝒳_T lies at radius p^n.
- For X = GSpec(ℚ_p), Q^Δ_{p,(1,∞)} = (D^×_{FF,Marc(ℚ_p)})^dR_{(1,∞)} and the coequalizer over (1, ∞) is Q_p^HK = GSpec(ℚ_p)^HK.
- Using the radius of 𝒳_T instead of that of X^Δ would place the Hodge–Tate locus at p^n for n ≥ 0 and exchange the roles of (0, p) and (1, ∞) in Proposition 4.2.13.

### 8.6 The p-adic twistor stack between the Fargues–Fontaine curve and the Hyodo–Kato stack

Construct the factorization FF_{X^⋄} → X^{Div¹} → FF^dR_{X^⋄} = X^HK of the natural map from the relative Fargues–Fontaine curve to its de Rham stack (ALRS (4.3.1), p. 65, ALRS line 3392). Prove that restriction of degree-one divisors on FF_A to GSpec(A) and FF_{A^u} gives a commutative square X^{Div¹} → X^HK over X^cone → (X^cone)^dR, cartesian when X is †-cohesive (ALRS Proposition 4.3.1, p. 65, ALRS line 3396), and that X^{Div¹} → X^HK is an isomorphism after base change to Div¹ ∖ Q_p^HT ≅ Div^{1,dR} ∖ GSpec(ℚ_p) (ALRS Proposition 4.3.2, p. 65, ALRS line 3406).

A proof route: Both statements follow from the pushout FF_T = FF_{T^u} ⊔_{T^u} T of thickened Fargues–Fontaine curves for T = GSpec(A) nilperfectoid; away from the Hodge–Tate locus FF_{A^u♭} → FF_A is an isomorphism.

*Needs:* §8.4; §8.5; §7.5; §6.3.

**Checks.**

- For X = GSpec(ℚ_p) the square reads Div¹ = A¹/G_m ×_{A^{1,dR}/G_m^dR} Q_p^HK (ALRS Proposition 4.8.1(1)).
- Over the complement of the Hodge–Tate locus, vector bundles on X^{Div¹} are vector bundles on X^HK, i.e. analytic D-modules on FF_{X^⋄} ∖ X^⋄.
- For X = ∅ all four corners are empty.

### 8.7 Descent for the analytic prismatization along †-formally smooth maps

Prove: (1) if f: Y → X is †-formally étale locally †-formally smooth, then f^Δ, f^{Div¹~} and f^{Div¹} are weakly †-formally smooth; (2) if moreover f is an arc-cover they are epimorphisms; (3) if f is †-formally smooth and Y, X are †-cohesive they are †-formally smooth (ALRS Theorem 4.7.1, p. 78, ALRS line 4040). In particular the prismatization, its perfection and the twistor stack satisfy descent along rigid étale covers and Tate-rational covers of smooth rigid spaces.

A proof route: On a degree-one divisor D ⊆ 𝒳_T with reduction D̄, †-formal smoothness gives an epimorphism Y(D) → Y(D̄) ×_{X(D̄)} X(D); sheafifying gives weak †-formal smoothness, and for †-cohesive source and target no sheafification is needed; reduce to the †-formally smooth case by Lemma 4.2.5 (8.3). For (2), f^{Δ,dR} is an epimorphism since f is an arc-cover, and Lemma 2.6.5 (4.1) applies.

*Needs:* §8.3; §4.1; §4.2.

**Checks.**

- A rigid étale cover of a smooth rigid space by charts étale over G_m^d is †-formally étale (4.2) and an arc-cover, so the twistor stacks of the charts cover X^{Div¹}.
- An open immersion that is not surjective is †-formally étale but not an arc-cover, and the induced map of prismatizations is not an epimorphism.
- The identity satisfies all hypotheses and its induced maps are isomorphisms.

### Examples

For X = GSpec(ℚ_p), Q_p^Δ is the moduli of degree-one divisors. The cyclotomic prism (X_cyc, [p]_q) and the Breuil–Kisin prism (lim_{x↦x^p} D^{<1} ∖ {0}, X − p) give cartesian squares with Q_p^HT whose upper-left corners are GSpec(ℚ_p(μ_{p^∞})) and GSpec(ℚ_p(p^{1/p^∞})). For a perfectoid space Y over ℚ_p, Y^HT ≅ Y, while Y^{Div¹} ≠ FF_Y.

### Dependencies

## Layer 9: Hodge–Tate geometry, Faltings' extension and explicit computations

This layer analyses the analytic Hodge–Tate stack as a gerbe for the overconvergent Breuil–Kisin twisted tangent bundle, absolutely and over a perfect prism; proves descent of Hodge–Tate stacks along quasi-syntomic covers; describes the formal and overconvergent Hodge–Tate stacks through cones; defines Faltings' extension through the cone and identifies it with the classical extension; computes the prismatization of ℚ_p; constructs the Breuil–Kisin twist; and constructs the prismatic logarithm with the resulting presentation of the perfect prismatization of G_m.

### 9.1 The Hodge–Tate stack as a gerbe

Let I_{Div¹} be the ideal of the Hodge–Tate divisor Q_p^HT → Div¹ and I its restriction to Q_p^HT (ALRS Definition 4.4.1, p. 65, ALRS line 3413). Prove that for a nilperfectoid A, a degree-one divisor D → FF_T and a factorization T → D → FF_T through the Hodge–Tate locus, O(D) → A is a square-zero extension with ideal Nil†(A) ⊗_A I_A[1], classified by the derivation d̃: A → A ⊕ Nil†(A) ⊗ I_A[2] obtained from the derivation of A^u attached to B⁺_dR(A^u)/ξ² → A^u through the connecting map of I_A[1] → I_{A^u}[1] → Nil†(A) ⊗ I_A[2] (ALRS Lemma 4.4.2, p. 65, ALRS line 3417); thus G_a^HT is a square-zero extension of G_a × Q_p^HT by G_a^†{1}[1]. Prove that for a Gelfand stack X there is a natural map π_X: X^HT → X × Q_p^HT through X^cone_s; that for †-cohesive X with a cotangent complex the square X^HT → X^dR over X^cone_s → (X^cone_s)^dR is cartesian and π_X is a principal homogeneous space for the overconvergent shifted twisted tangent complex (T_X[1]{1})^†; and that π_X is the fibre of a derivation d̃_X: X × Q_p^HT → (T_X{1}[2])^†, so that for formally smooth X with tangent bundle T_X, π_X is an epimorphism and a gerbe banded by T_X^†{1}, where {1} is the twist by I (ALRS Proposition 4.4.3, p. 66, ALRS line 3481).

A proof route: Base change Proposition 4.3.1 (8.6) along BG_m → A¹/G_m and Div¹ → A¹/G_m. The pushout FF_T = FF_{T^u} ⊔_{T^u} T gives O(D) = A ×_{A^u} (A^u ⊕ I_{A^u}[1]) over the Hodge–Tate point; †-cohesiveness of X evaluates X on this square, and Lemma 2.8.6 (5.1) identifies X^cone_s = T_X[1]{1}, whose map to its de Rham stack has fibre (T_X[1]{1})^†.

*Needs:* §8.6; §5.1; §5.2; §4.8; §4.4; PadicHodgeTheory §2.2.

**Checks.**

- For X = GSpec(ℚ_p), T_X = 0 and π_X is the identity of Q_p^HT.
- For X = A¹, X^HT → A¹ × Q_p^HT is a gerbe banded by G_a^†{1}.
- For Y = GSpec(C_p), L_{C_p/ℚ_p} = C_p(1)[1] (4.5) gives T_Y[1]{1} = O, the twists cancelling; Y × Q_p^HT is a G_m^† ≅ G_a^†-gerbe over Y, and π_Y makes Y^HT a torsor over it under (T_Y[1]{1})^† = G_a^†, which trivializes the gerbe, so Y^HT ≅ Y as in 8.3.
- For X = A¹ the band restricted over the origin is G_a^†{1} = G_a^† ⊗ I on Q_p^HT, whose arithmetic Sen weight is 1 because I ≅ Ô(1) (9.7, 11.2); the untwisted band G_a^† has Sen weight 0, so the twist {1} is detected by the Sen operator.

### 9.2 Relative twistor and Hodge–Tate stacks over a perfect prism

Let (S, 𝒳, D) be a perfect analytic prism and X → D a †-cohesive map of Gelfand stacks. Prove that the squares relating X^{Div¹/𝒳}, X^{HK/𝒳}, X^HK, X^{cone/(D,𝒳/φ^ℤ)} and its relative and absolute de Rham stacks are cartesian, and that if X admits a cotangent complex then X^{HT/D} = X ×_{(T_{X/D}{1}[2])^†} X along 0 and the derivation d̃_X, so that for X → D formally smooth X^{HT/D} → X is a gerbe banded by T^†_{X/D}{1}, {1} being the twist by the ideal of D ⊆ 𝒳 (ALRS Proposition 4.4.4, p. 68, ALRS line 3535). For formally smooth X → D prove that the pushout of X^{HT/D} along BT^†_{X/D}{1} → BT_{X/D}{1} is the stack of square-zero lifts of X to the first infinitesimal neighbourhood D(1) (ALRS Remark 4.4.5, p. 68, ALRS line 3552).

A proof route: Identical to 9.1, using the relative cone over (D, 𝒳/φ^ℤ) of Definition 2.8.9 and Proposition 2.8.15 (5.2).

*Needs:* §9.1; §5.2; §8.2.

**Checks.**

- For X = D, T_{X/D} = 0 and X^{HT/D} = D.
- For a smooth curve X over a perfectoid field C with prism given by FF_{C♭} and the untilt C, X^{HT/C} is a gerbe banded by T^†_X{1}, and its pushout to T_X{1} is the gerbe of lifts of X to B⁺_dR(C)/ξ².
- The relative Hodge–Tate gerbe need not split, in contrast with the archimedean Hodge stack (ALRS Remark 1.14); the two are distinguished by the twist {1}.

### 9.3 Descent of Hodge–Tate stacks along quasi-syntomic covers

Prove that if f: Y → X is an epimorphism of Gelfand stacks which is infinitesimally cohesive and admits a cotangent complex L_{Y/X} perfect of amplitude [−1, 0], then f^HT: Y^HT → X^HT is an epimorphism (ALRS Theorem 4.7.2, p. 78, ALRS line 4062). In particular Hodge–Tate stacks satisfy descent along formally étale !-covers such as Tate-rational covers, which propagates 9.1 from smooth affinoids to smooth rigid spaces (ALRS footnote 27, p. 69, ALRS line 3631).

A proof route: A point GSpec(G_a^HT(A)) → X with G_a^HT(A) = A ×_{A ⊕ Nil†(A){1}[2]} A lifts along f !-locally: infinitesimal cohesiveness reduces to lifting along the trivial and twisted derivations, and the obstruction lies in a group that vanishes !-locally because of the amplitude bound.

*Needs:* §9.1; §4.6; §4.7.

**Checks.**

- A Tate-rational cover of a smooth affinoid has L = 0 and is an epimorphism, so the Hodge–Tate stacks of its pieces cover X^HT.
- The zero section 0 → A¹ has L = ℚ_p[1] of amplitude [−1, 0] but is not an epimorphism; its Hodge–Tate map misses the points of A¹^HT over A¹ ∖ {0}.
- The identity has L = 0 and induces an isomorphism.

### 9.4 Formal and overconvergent Hodge–Tate stacks

Define the overconvergent and formal Hodge–Tate stacks X^{†-HT} = X^{Div¹} ×_{A¹/G_m} A^{1,†}/G_m and X^{HT^} = X^{Div¹} ×_{A¹/G_m} Â¹/G_m, and their relative versions over a perfect prism (ALRS Definition 4.5.1, p. 69, ALRS line 3602). Prove that for †-cohesive X the squares relating X^{HT^}, X^{†-HT}, X^dR, X^{cone^}, X^{†-cone} and (X^cone_s)^dR are cartesian, and that for formally smooth X with a cotangent complex X^dR → (X^cone_s)^dR = (X/T_X(−1) ⋊ G_m)^dR is a (T_X(−1) ⋊ G_m)^dR-torsor, hence so are X^{HT^} → X^{cone^} and X^{†-HT} → X^{†-cone} (ALRS Proposition 4.5.2, p. 69, ALRS line 3614); prove the relative version over a perfect prism, with a T_{X/D}{1}^dR-torsor (ALRS Proposition 4.5.3, p. 69, ALRS line 3630).

A proof route: Base change 9.1 along Â¹/G_m → A^{1,†}/G_m → A¹/G_m, using (Â¹/G_m)^dR = (A^{1,†}/G_m)^dR = BG_m^dR; for the relative torsor, the perfectoidization of the special fibre of the relative cone is a trivial BT_{X/D}{1}^⋄-torsor through the first infinitesimal neighbourhood of X^⋄ → FF_{X^⋄} (Proposition 2.8.15, 5.2).

*Needs:* §9.1; §9.2; §5.1.

**Checks.**

- For X = GSpec(ℚ_p), Q_p^{HT^} = Spf(K_∞[[t]])/ℤ_p^{×,la} with K_∞ = ℚ_p(μ_{p^∞}), because (B⁺_dR(ℚ_p^cyc)/t^n)^la = K_∞[t]/t^n (ALRS §6.7, line 9169).
- The formal and overconvergent Hodge–Tate stacks differ: the formal one sees only nilpotent thickenings of the divisor, the overconvergent one its †-neighbourhood; for non-Berkovich X only the formal statement of 9.6 holds.
- For X = ∅ all stacks are empty.

### 9.5 Faltings' extension through the cone and its agreement with the classical extension

For a smooth rigid space X over ℚ_p define Faltings' extension FE_X as the extension 0 → O_{X̂^⋄}{1} → FE_X → Ω¹_X ⊗ O_{X̂^⋄} → 0 on X̂^⋄ whose T_X{1}-torsor is X̂^⋄ ×_{X^cone_s} (X × BG_m), for the map X × BG_m → X^cone_s of Lemma 2.8.6 and X̂^⋄ → X^HT → X^cone_s; for a smoothoid X over an affinoid perfectoid D with a lift X̃ to B⁺_dR(D)/ξ², define FE^{X̃}_X through X̂^⋄ ×_{X^{cone/(D,FF_D)}_s} X (ALRS Definition 4.6.1, p. 70, ALRS line 3674). Prove that X̂^⋄ → FF^∧_{X^⋄} ×_{X^dR} X is, locally on the pro-étale site X_proét^{ω₁}, a regular closed immersion with formal completion Spf(OB⁺_dR,X) (ALRS Lemma 4.6.4, p. 73, ALRS line 3819), so that L_{X̂^⋄/X} ≅ gr¹(OB⁺_dR,X)[1] (ALRS Remark 4.6.5, p. 74, ALRS line 3876); that, writing Spf^{≥0} for spectra of ℕ-filtrations (ALRS Construction 4.6.6, p. 75, ALRS line 3891), Spf^{≥0}(B⁺_dR,X) is the algebraic formal cone of X̂^⋄ and Spf^{≥0}(B⁺_dR,X) ×_{X^{cone-alg^}} (X × Â¹/G_m^alg) = Spf^{≥0}(OB⁺_dR,X) (ALRS Proposition 4.6.8, p. 75, ALRS line 3920); and that X̂^⋄ ×_{X^cone_s} (X × BG_m) ≅ (AnSpec(OC_X))^Gelf, so that FE_X is the classical Faltings' extension 0 → Ô_X(1) → gr¹OB⁺_dR,X → Ô_X ⊗ Ω¹_X → 0 of PadicHodgeTheory §2.3 (ALRS Corollary 4.6.10, p. 76, ALRS line 3966; Sch13 Corollary 6.14, p. 39, Sch13 line 1787).

A proof route: For Lemma 4.6.4 reduce, on a toric chart X → T^d with perfectoid cover X_∞, to the regular immersion X → X ×_{X^dR} X = (X ⊂ X × X)^† and identify the regular sequence (log[ε], [T_i♭] ⊗ 1 − 1 ⊗ T_i). For Proposition 4.6.8 use that formally étale maps have trivial algebraic cones (Remark 2.9.7(1)) and that the cone of a Zariski closed immersion is the spectrum of its adic filtration (Remark 2.9.7(2)). Corollary 4.6.10 is the base change of (4.6.5) along BG_m^alg → Â¹/G_m^alg, using gr^•OB_dR,X = ⊕_i gr⁰OB_dR,X(i) and gr⁰OB_dR,X = OC_X, followed by Gelfandification.

- For X = G_m with the toric cover T^{1/p^∞}, the class log([T♭]/T) in gr¹OB⁺_dR lifts dT/T and the generator γ of ℤ_p(1) moves it by t = log[ε]; the cocycle γ ↦ t is a nonzero class in H¹(ℤ_p(1), Ĉ(1)), so FE_X is a non-split Galois-equivariant extension.
- The subobject is O{1} = Ô(1), not Ô: the cocycle γ ↦ t takes values in the Tate twist, and an extension of Ô ⊗ Ω¹ by Ô would have an equivariant splitting on the toric cover.
- For X = GSpec(ℚ_p), L_{X̂^⋄/X} = gr¹(B⁺_dR(C_p))[1] = C_p(1)[1], matching 4.5.

### 9.6 The formal Hodge–Tate squares

Prove that for a smooth rigid space X over ℚ_p there is a cartesian square X^{HT^} → X^dR over X^{cone^} → (X^cone_s)^dR = (X^cone)^dR ×_{(A¹/G_m)^dR} BG_m^dR, where the lower right term is the classifying stack B_{X^dR × BG_m^dR}T_X{1}^dR, the map X^dR → BG_m^dR is the Tate twist, and the T_X{1}^⋄-torsor on X^⋄ given by the right vertical map is Faltings' extension; if X is a Berkovich space the formal completion may be replaced by the overconvergent neighbourhood (ALRS Corollary 4.6.11, p. 77, ALRS line 3985). Prove the relative version for a smoothoid X over a perfectoid D with a smooth lift X̃ to B⁺_dR(D)/t², with FE^{X̃}_X and relative de Rham stacks over D^∧ (or D^†) (ALRS Corollary 4.6.12, p. 77, ALRS line 3999).

A proof route: X^cone_s → X^{cone^} is an epimorphism, so it suffices to prove the statement for Hodge–Tate stacks; by descent along formally étale !-covers (9.3) reduce to affinoid, hence †-cohesive, X, where it follows from 9.4 and Definition 4.6.1.

*Needs:* §9.4; §9.5; §9.3.

**Checks.**

- For X = GSpec(ℚ_p), T_X = 0 and the square reads Q_p^{HT^} = Â¹/G_m ×_{BG_m^dR} GSpec(ℚ_p), the map GSpec(ℚ_p) → BG_m^dR being the Tate twist (9.7).
- For X = G_m the T_X{1}^⋄-torsor is the torsor of lifts of dT/T in gr¹OB⁺_dR, the class computed in 9.5.
- For a smooth rigid space which is not a Berkovich space (not partially proper and not affinoid) only the formal version is asserted.

### 9.7 The analytic prismatization of ℚ_p

Let 1 + D̃^{<1}_{ℚ_p} = lim_{x↦x^p}(1 + D^{<1}_{ℚ_p}) with coordinate q and Frobenius q ↦ q^p, and let (S_cyc, X_cyc, I) be the cyclotomic prism with divisor ([p]_q). Prove: (1) the square Q_p^Δ → Q_p^{Δ,dR} over μ_BK: A¹/G_m → A^{1,dR}/G_m^dR is cartesian; (2) the square Q_p^HT → GSpec(ℚ_p) over ι: BG_m → BG_m^dR is cartesian, so π_{ℚ_p}: Q_p^HT → GSpec(ℚ_p) is a BG_m^†-torsor, a gerbe banded by G_m^†; (3) along X_cyc → Q_p^Δ, I_BK pulls back to (log(q)/(q − 1)) and I_Δ along X_cyc → Div¹~ → Div¹ to (log q); (4) X_cyc → Div¹~ induces Div¹~ ≅ X_cyc/ℤ_p^{×,la} with a·(q, q^{1/p}, …) = (q^a, q^{a/p}, …), hence Div¹ ≅ X_cyc/ℚ_p^{×,la} and Q_p^HT ≅ GSpec(ℚ_p(μ_{p^∞}))/ℤ_p^{×,la}, the action factoring through the Galois action of ℤ_p^{×,sm} via the cyclotomic character; and the cartesian square of 8.6 becomes ((1 + D̃^{<1}) ∖ {1})/ℚ_p^{×,la} over A¹/G_m via log (ALRS Proposition 4.8.1, p. 79, ALRS line 4112). Prove that ι^dR: GSpec(ℚ_p) → BG_m^dR is classified by the Tate twist Ô ⊗ ℚ_p(1) ≅ gr¹B⁺_dR on Spa(ℚ_p)_proét (ALRS §4.8, p. 81, ALRS line 4202), and that D^×_{FF,ℚ_p^cyc} → (1 + D̃^{<1}_{ℚ_p}) ∖ {1}, q ↦ [ε^{1/p}], is Γ-equivariant through χ and sends the prism ideal to the ideal of the untilt ℚ_p^cyc (ALRS Example 4.8.4, p. 81, ALRS line 4206).

A proof route: (1)–(2) are Proposition 4.3.1 for X = GSpec(ℚ_p). For (3), log(q)/(q − 1) has simple zeros exactly at the zeros of [p]_{q^{p^n}}, n ≥ 0; on Div¹~ the perfected ideal is the limit of (log(q)/(q^{p^{-n}} − 1)), with zeros those of log q. For (4) use Q_p^HK = (1 + D̃^{<1})^dR and that log is †-formally étale.

*Needs:* §8.6; §9.1; §8.4; §7.6; §3.4.

**Checks.**

- Q_p^HT → GSpec(ℚ_p) is a gerbe banded by G_m^† ≅ G_a^† (via exp and log on the overconvergent neighbourhood of 1); compare AHLB Theorem 1.2, where the integral Hodge–Tate stack of ℤ_p is BG_m^♯ (AHLB line 42), and PrismaticCohomologyPartII §4.12, where WCart^HT ≅ Spf ℤ_p × BG_m^♯: the rational analytic theory replaces G_m^♯ by G_m^†.
- An element a ∈ ℤ_p^× acts on X_cyc by q^{1/p^n} ↦ q^{a/p^n}; the element p of ℚ_p^× acts by the Frobenius q ↦ q^p.
- The pullback of I to Q_p^HT is Ĉ(1); its arithmetic Sen operator (11.2) is multiplication by 1, matching the convention Θ_{O{n}} = n of PrismaticCohomologyPartII §4.13 and HT(χ_p) = +1 of FiniteFlatGroupsAndIntegralPadicHodgeTheory §R07.P7.2.
- The upper-left corner of the cyclotomic square is the uncompleted GSpec(ℚ_p(μ_{p^∞})), not GSpec(ℚ_p^cyc); the completed field gives the perfectoid Hodge–Tate stack of 8.3 instead.

### 9.8 The Breuil–Kisin twist

Let O_{Q_p^Δ}⟨1⟩ be the pullback along Q_p^Δ → D^{×,dR}_{FF,Marc(ℚ_p)} of the line bundle of the isocrystal (ℚ_p, p^{-1}φ), a φ-equivariant line bundle. Define the Breuil–Kisin twist O_{Q_p^Δ}{1} = I_BK ⊗ O⟨1⟩ with its Frobenius φ^*I_BK ≅ I_Δ^{-1} I_BK, and O{n} = O{1}^{⊗n} (ALRS Construction 4.9.1, p. 82, ALRS line 4233). Construct the perfected twist O_{Div¹~}{1} = ⊗_{n∈ℤ} φ^n(I_Δ) with Frobenius structure, descending to O_{Div¹}{1} = I_{Div¹}⟨1⟩ on Div¹; prove that its pullback along FF_{Q_p^⋄} → Div¹ is the Tate twist ℚ_p(1) as a pro-étale local system, whereas O_{Div¹}⟨1⟩ pulls back to the line bundle of Frobenius slope one (ALRS Remark 4.9.3, p. 82, ALRS line 4278). Compare with the integral Breuil–Kisin twist of PrismaticCohomologyPartII §3.9, built as a limit of I_k/I_k² along transition maps divided by p, which correspond rationally to the twist by O⟨1⟩ (ALRS Remark 4.9.2, p. 82, ALRS line 4239).

*Needs:* §8.4; §9.7; §7.4; §6.3; VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB4.

The API has the following laws.

- O{1} carries the φ-structure φ^*O{1} ≅ I_Δ^{-1} ⊗ O{1} obtained from φ^*I_BK ≅ I_Δ^{-1}I_BK and the slope twist of O⟨1⟩.
- The restriction of O{1} to Q_p^HT is the conormal ideal I ≅ Ô(1) of the Hodge–Tate divisor.
- The pullback of O_{Div¹}{1} to FF_{Q_p^⋄} is the Tate twist O ⊗ ℚ_p(1), a slope-zero line bundle; the pullback of O_{Div¹}⟨1⟩ has slope one.
- O{m} ⊗ O{n} ≅ O{m + n} and O{0} = O, compatibly with Frobenius structures.

**Checks.**

- On the cyclotomic prism, e = (log q/(q − 1)) ⊗ e⟨1⟩ generates O{1}, and φ(log q/(q − 1)) = p·log q/(q^p − 1) = p·[p]_q^{-1}·log q/(q − 1), while φ(e⟨1⟩) = p^{-1}e⟨1⟩; hence φ(e) = [p]_q^{-1}·e, matching [p]_q·φ(e) = e of PrismaticCohomologyPartII §3.9.
- Without the factor O⟨1⟩ the generator would satisfy φ(e′) = p·[p]_q^{-1}·e′, off by p from the integral normalization.
- O{0} = O with the identity Frobenius structure.
- Away from the Hodge–Tate locus I is trivial and O{1} ≅ O⟨1⟩, matching the dualizing complexes of 12.2 on Div¹ ∖ Q_p^HT ≅ Div^{1,dR} ∖ GSpec(ℚ_p).

### 9.9 The prismatic logarithm and the prismatization of G_m

Let G̃_m = lim_{x↦x^p} G_m and ℤ_p(1)^sm = fib(G̃_m → G_m). Prove G̃_m ≅ G̃_m^dR ×_{G_m^dR} G_m (ALRS Lemma 4.10.2, p. 84, ALRS line 4348); construct the φ-equivariant Teichmüller map of commutative group stacks ρ: G̃_{m,Q_p^Δ} → G_m^Δ (ALRS Construction 4.10.3, p. 84, ALRS line 4355) and prove that ρ is an epimorphism with G_m^Δ = G̃_{m,Q_p^Δ}/G, G = fib(ρ), with cartesian squares relating G, (1 + D̃^{<1}) ×_{GSpec ℚ_p} Q_p^Δ and (1 + D^{<1})^Δ (ALRS Lemma 4.10.4, p. 85, ALRS line 4403). Define the prismatic logarithm as the unique φ-equivariant map of commutative group stacks log_Δ: G → G_{a,Q_p^Δ}{1} fitting in the diagram of fibre sequences with β = log ∘ pr_1 twisted by ⟨1⟩ and γ = (log)^cone ∘ μ_BK (ALRS Construction 4.10.5, p. 86, ALRS line 4454). Prove that log_Δ is †-formally étale, with a fibre square over its de Rham stack and an exact sequence 0 → G_a^† ⊗ G_{a,Q_p^Δ}{1} → G → ℤ_p(1)^sm → 0 (ALRS Theorem 4.10.6, p. 87, ALRS line 4494); that the logarithm induces fibre sequences with rows G → (1 + D̃^{<1})_{Q_p^Δ} → (1 + D^{<1})^Δ and G[1/p] → (1 + D̃^{<1})_{Q_p^Δ} → G_a^Δ, recovering on arc-stacks 0 → ℚ_p(1) → BC(O(1)) → G_a → 0 (ALRS Lemma 4.10.10, p. 89, ALRS line 4599); and that over the cyclotomic prism the section q♭ = (q, q^{1/p}, …) gives G^{Div¹~}|_{X_cyc} ≅ q^{ℤ_p^la}, the action on G̃_{m,X_cyc} with coordinate T is a·T^{1/p^n} = q^{a/p^n}T^{1/p^n}, G_m^{Div¹~/X_cyc} ≅ G̃_{m,X_cyc}/ℤ_p^la, and G_m^{Div¹~} ≅ G̃_{m,X_cyc}/(ℤ_p^{×,la} ⋉ ℤ_p^la) with (a, b)·(q♭, T♭) = (q♭^a, q♭^b T♭) (ALRS Theorem 4.10.13, p. 89, ALRS line 4622).

A proof route: ρ is an epimorphism because lim_{x↦x^p}A^{u,×} → (A^{♭,♯})^× is surjective arc-locally and the remaining nilpotent part is handled by †-thickenings. β and γ are †-formally étale (1 + D̃^{<1} → 1 + D^{<1} and log are; (1 + D^{<1})^Δ → (1 + D^{<1})^cone is by 8.4), hence so is log_Δ. Over X_cyc, the pullback square (4.10.8) and the description of G by log_Δ identify G with q^{ℤ_p^la}.

*Needs:* §9.7; §9.8; §8.4; §7.6; §5.1; §4.1.

**Checks.**

- On X_cyc, log_Δ(q) = log(q) = (q − 1)·e for the generator e of 9.8, and p^{-1}φ(log q) = p^{-1}log(q^p) = log q, so log_Δ(q) is φ-invariant for the twisted Frobenius; compare PrismaticCohomologyPartIII §6.10, where (q − 1)e_A = log_Δ(q^p) integrally.
- Without the twist ⟨1⟩, φ(log q) = p·log q, so the untwisted logarithm is not φ-equivariant.
- ℤ_p(1)^sm = GSpec(ℚ_p[T^{1/p^∞}]/(T − 1)), the locally constant functions on ℤ_p(1), and G^{dR} ≅ ℤ_p(1)^sm × D^{×,dR}_{FF,Marc(ℚ_p)}.
- On arc-stacks Lemma 4.10.10 becomes the fundamental exact sequence 0 → ℚ_p(1) → BC(O(1)) → G_a → 0 of VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB3 (fundamental-exact-sequence), consistent with 7.6.

### Examples

Q_p^HT ≅ GSpec(ℚ_p(μ_{p^∞}))/ℤ_p^{×,la} is a gerbe banded by G_m^† over GSpec(ℚ_p); Div¹ ≅ X_cyc/ℚ_p^{×,la}. On the cyclotomic prism the Breuil–Kisin twist has generator e = (log q/(q − 1)) ⊗ e⟨1⟩ with φ(e) = [p]_q^{-1}·e, and log_Δ(q) = (q − 1)·e. For X = G_m over the cyclotomic prism the perfect prismatization is G̃_{m,X_cyc}/ℤ_p^la with a·T^{1/p^n} = q^{a/p^n}T^{1/p^n}.

## Layer 10: Semilinear solid representations and decompletion by locally analytic vectors

This layer is independent of the prismatization. It develops semilinear solid representations of p-adic Lie groups on Gelfand rings, identifies continuous and locally analytic representations with quasi-coherent sheaves on BG^cont and BG^la, and proves the decompletion theorem for Berkovich spaces with a continuous action of a p-adic Lie group: the sheaf of locally analytic functions, classical decompletion, and the equivalence of perfect complexes under strong decompletion. It then verifies strong decompletion in the arithmetic, geometric and mixed Sen-theoretic situations through the Tate–Sen axioms, and decompletes torsors.

### 10.1 Semilinear solid representations

For a light locally profinite group Π let Rep^■_ℤ(Π) = D(ℤ_■[Π]) be the category of solid Π-representations, symmetric monoidal through the Hopf algebra ℤ_■[Π]. For R ∈ CAlg(D(ℤ_■[Π])) let Rep^■_R(Π) = Mod_R(D(ℤ_■[Π])) be the category of R-semilinear solid representations. Construct the associative algebra Λ_R(Π) with underlying solid abelian group R ⊗ ℤ_■[Π] and an equivalence Rep^■_R(Π) ≃ LMod_{Λ_R(Π)}(D(ℤ_■)) by monadicity of the conservative, limit- and colimit-preserving forgetful functor, together with algebra maps ℤ_■[Π] → Λ_R(Π) and R → Λ_R(Π) recovering the rule (a[g])(b[h]) = a·g(b)[gh] (ALRS Construction 5.2.1, p. 93, ALRS line 4817).

*Needs:* SolidAnalyticRings §1.5; EnhancedDerivedSheaves §E5:abstract.2; required contract `analytic-stacks`.

The API has the following laws.

- Rep^■_R(Π) ≃ LMod_{Λ_R(Π)}(D(ℤ_■)), compatibly with the forgetful functors.
- The algebra maps R → Λ_R(Π) and ℤ_■[Π] → Λ_R(Π) satisfy [g]·a = g(a)·[g].
- Λ_R(Π) is functorial in equivariant algebra maps R → R′ and in group homomorphisms.

**Checks.**

- For Π trivial, Λ_R(Π) = R.
- For R = ℤ with trivial action, Λ_R(Π) = ℤ_■[Π], the solid group algebra.
- For Π = ℤ/2 acting on R = ℚ_p × ℚ_p by swapping, Λ_R(Π) ≅ M_2(ℚ_p), a simple algebra.
- The untwisted product (a[g])(b[h]) = ab[gh] would give the commutative algebra (ℚ_p × ℚ_p) ⊗ ℚ_p[ℤ/2] ≅ ℚ_p⁴ in the previous example, which is not M_2(ℚ_p).

### 10.2 Continuous representations as quasi-coherent sheaves on BΠ^cont

Let Π^cont be the Berkovich space of ℚ_p-valued continuous functions on Π and BΠ^cont = GSpec(ℚ_p)/Π^cont. Prove that for profinite Π pullback along f: GSpec(ℚ_p) → BΠ^cont identifies D(BΠ^cont) with right C(Π, ℚ_p)-comodules in solid ℚ_p-vector spaces, that D(BΠ^cont) has a t-structure for which f^* is t-exact and is the left-completed derived category of its heart, and that if Π has finite p-cohomological dimension then f is D-proper and descendable, so BΠ^cont is D-proper over GSpec(ℚ_p); BΠ^cont is !-able whenever Π has an open subgroup of finite p-cohomological dimension (ALRS Lemma 5.2.2, p. 94, ALRS line 4860). Construct a symmetric monoidal functor Φ: D(BΠ^cont) → Rep^■_{ℚ_p}(Π) compatible with forgetful functors and natural in Π (ALRS Construction 5.2.3, p. 94, ALRS line 4906). Prove that if ℚ_p is a perfect ℚ_{p,■}[Π_0]-module for a compact open Π_0, which holds for p-adic Lie groups by the Lazard–Serre resolution (RJRC22 Theorem 5.7, p. 45, RJRC22 line 2227), then Φ has a D(BΠ^cont)-linear right adjoint Φ^R(M) = Γ(Π_0, M ⊗ C(Π_0, ℚ_p)), the unit ℚ_p → Φ^R(ℚ_p) is an equivalence, and Φ is fully faithful (ALRS Lemma 5.2.5, p. 95, ALRS line 4957; ALRS Lemma 5.2.7, p. 97, ALRS line 5072).

A proof route: Construct Φ on the comodule presentation: a right C(Π_0, ℚ_p)-comodule M → M ⊗ C(Π_0, ℚ_p) becomes a ℚ_{p,■}[Π_0]-module through the evaluation pairing C(Π_0, ℚ_p) ⊗ ℚ_{p,■}[Π_0] → ℚ_p, and glue over compact opens. ALRS constructs Φ through Mann's solid sheaves on classifying stacks (Man26 Lemmas 10.3 and 10.5) and the nuclear comparison of AM24 Lemma 3.29; the two constructions agree on nuclear objects, which is recorded as a Check. The right adjoint is computed by the projection formula of Lemma 5.2.7, which holds because ℚ_p has a finite free resolution over ℤ_{p,■}[Π_0]; Φ^R(ℚ_p) = Γ(Π_0, C(Π_0, ℚ_p)) = ℚ_p by Shapiro's lemma, without Gestalten.

*Needs:* §10.1; §2.2; §2.5; §2.3; required contract `analytic-stacks-betti-nuclear`; NoncommutativeAndEquivariantIwasawa §0.1; NoncommutativeAndEquivariantIwasawa §0.6.

**Checks.**

- For Π trivial, D(BΠ^cont) = D(ℚ_p) and Φ is the identity.
- For Π = ℤ_p the character a ↦ (1 + p)^a (p odd) is a one-dimensional C(ℤ_p, ℚ_p)-comodule, and Φ sends it to ℚ_p with ℤ_p acting through it.
- The regular representation ℚ_{p,■}[Π] is not in the essential image of Φ, being a comodule over no C(Π_0, ℚ_p) (ALRS Remark 5.2.4(1)); for Π = ∏_ℕ ℤ_p, Φ is not fully faithful (ALRS Remark 5.2.4(2)), so the Lie group hypothesis is needed.
- On nuclear objects Φ agrees with Mann's identification of nuclear solid ℚ_p-sheaves on (∗/Π)_proét with nuclear solid representations (Man26 Lemma 10.5).

### 10.3 The groups G_r, G^la and locally analytic representations

Let G be a compact p-adic Lie group and G_0 ⊂ G an open normal uniform pro-p subgroup with ordered basis g_1, …, g_d, G_0 ≅ ℤ_p^d, and p-valuation; after shrinking G_0 its group law and the conjugation action of G extend to integral power series on the polydisc D^d. Let G_0(r) ⊂ G_0(1) be the polydisc of radius r ∈ (0, 1] ∩ ℚ, G_r the induced rigid analytic group ⊔_{g ∈ G/G_r} gG_0(r), G^la = ⋂_{r→0} G_r with O(G^la) = C^la_G = colim_r O(G_r), G_{<r} = ⋃_{r′<r} G_{r′} and G_{≤r} = ⋂_{r′>r} G_{r′} (ALRS §5.2.2, p. 97, ALRS line 5086; ALRS Definition 5.2.8, p. 98, ALRS line 5110). A solid representation M is locally analytic if M^la := Γ(G, C^la_G ⊗ M) → M is an isomorphism (ALRS Definition 5.2.9, p. 98, ALRS line 5124). Prove: BG^cont → BG^la is D-proper with pushforward of O equal to O, so pullback is fully faithful; Ψ: D(BG^la) → Rep^■_{ℚ_p}(G) is fully faithful with a linear right adjoint, which for compact G is (−)^la, so the essential image is the category of locally analytic representations (ALRS Lemma 5.2.10, p. 98, ALRS line 5137); define Rep^{<r} and Rep^{≤r} as D(GSpec(ℚ_p)/G_{<r}) and D(GSpec(ℚ_p)/G_{≤r}) (ALRS Definition 5.2.11, p. 99, ALRS line 5163); GSpec(ℚ_p) → BG^la and → BG^{≤r} are D-proper and descendable with BG^la, BG^{≤r} suave, and GSpec(ℚ_p) → BG^{<r} is cohomologically smooth with BG^{<r} prim (ALRS Lemma 5.2.12, p. 99, ALRS line 5169). For a rigid analytic group G with G = G(ℚ_p) compact, G^la agrees with G(ℚ_p)^la of 3.4.

A proof route: D-properness of BG^cont → BG^la is checked after pullback along GSpec(ℚ_p) → BG^la, where G^la/G^cont → GSpec(ℚ_p) is D-proper since G^la is affinoid and BG^cont is D-proper (10.2); the pushforward computes locally analytic vectors (RJRC Proposition 6.1.5).

*Needs:* §10.2; §3.4; LocallyAnalyticDistributionsPartII §ND.0; NoncommutativeAndEquivariantIwasawa §0.1; NoncommutativeAndEquivariantIwasawa §0.6; required contract `analytic-stacks`.

The API has the following laws.

- For compact G, Ψ identifies D(BG^la) with the full subcategory of locally analytic solid representations, and Ψ^R ∘ pullback = (−)^la.
- The ind-systems {C^r_G}, {C^{<r}_G}, {C^{≤r}_G} are ind-equivalent, so C^la_G = colim C^r_G = colim C^{<r}_G = colim C^{≤r}_G (RJRC Remark 2.1.5).
- BG^cont → BG^la is D-proper with O ≅ s_*O; GSpec(ℚ_p) → BG^la is D-proper and descendable.
- The coordinates and p-valuation are those of LocallyAnalyticDistributionsPartII §ND.0 (p-valuation, ordered-basis-chart, p-valued-analytic-structure).

**Checks.**

- For G = ℤ_p, C^la_G is the space of locally analytic functions on ℤ_p, and the character a ↦ (1 + p)^a is locally analytic for p odd (its Mahler coefficients p^n satisfy |p^n|r^n → 0 for 1 < r < p).
- For G finite, G^la = G^sm = G^cont and every solid representation is locally analytic.
- The representation C(ℤ_p, ℚ_p) with the regular action is not locally analytic: its locally analytic vectors are C^la(ℤ_p, ℚ_p) ⊊ C(ℤ_p, ℚ_p).
- For a Banach representation B, the cohomology of the derived locally analytic vectors equals R^iLA(B) of LocallyAnalyticRepresentationsOfLocalGroups §LR.2 (derived-analytic-vectors), and agrees with RJRC22 Theorems 4.36, 5.3 and 5.5; the solid theory of §LR.3 (solid-analytic-vectors) is the κ-condensed counterpart.

### 10.4 Lazard's criterion and binomial analytic functions

Prove that for a uniform pro-p group G with coordinates G ≅ ℤ_p^d and a ℚ_p-Banach space M, a function f: G → M with binomial expansion f(x) = Σ_α c_α binom(x, α) is locally analytic if and only if there is r > 1 with ‖c_α‖ r^{|α|} → 0 (ALRS Theorem 5.2.14, p. 101, ALRS line 5314; Laz65 Chapitre III, (1.3.9) Corollaire, p. 77, Laz65 line 2873). For a uniform Banach ℚ_p-algebra Λ with pseudo-uniformizer ϖ and the spectral norm normalized by |ϖ| = 1/2, define for r > 1 the ϖ-complete module C_{r,ϖ}(G, Λ°) of series Σ c_α binom(x, α) with |c_α| r^{τ(α)} ≤ 1 and → 0 (ALRS Definition 5.2.15, p. 102, ALRS line 5364), prove that it is a subalgebra of C(G, Λ°) and, for |p| ≤ 1/2 and 1 < r < 2, a Hopf Λ°-algebra (ALRS Lemma 5.2.16, p. 102, ALRS line 5379; ALRS Lemma 5.2.17, p. 102, ALRS line 5411), and define the analytic group G^Bin_{r,ϖ} = GSpec(C_{r,ϖ}(G, Λ)) and its semilinear representations (ALRS Definition 5.2.18, p. 104, ALRS line 5492). Prove that BG^la ×_{GSpec ℚ_p} GSpec(Λ) → BG^Bin_{r,ϖ} has the properties of ALRS Lemma 5.2.21, p. 105, ALRS line 5617.

A proof route: Lazard's criterion is Laz65 III.1.3.9 (the d-variable form of Amice's theorem). Multiplicativity of C_{r,ϖ} follows from the estimates on products of binomial coefficients; the Hopf structure needs |p|_ϖ ≤ 1/2 so that the group law is analytic on the relevant polydiscs; the Lazard–Serre resolution of ℤ_p by finite free ℤ_{p,■}[G]-modules (RJRC22 Theorem 5.7) controls group cohomology.

*Needs:* §10.3; LocallyAnalyticDistributionsPartII §ND.0; LocallyAnalyticDistributions §0.1.

**Checks.**

- For G = ℤ_p and p odd, f(a) = (1 + p)^a has c_n = p^n and satisfies the criterion for every r < p.
- f(a) = Σ_k p^k binom(a, p^k) is continuous (Mahler coefficients tend to 0) but p^{-k}r^{p^k} → ∞ for every r > 1, so f is not locally analytic.
- A polynomial function on ℤ_p^d has finitely many nonzero c_α and is locally analytic for every r.

### 10.5 Decompletions of semilinear representations

For a commutative algebra R in solid G-representations with locally analytic vectors R^la, say that M ∈ Rep^■_R(G) admits a locally analytic decompletion as an R-module if it lies in the essential image of Rep^la_{R^la}(G), equivalently M^la ⊗_{R^la} R → M is an equivalence; similarly for ≤r-analytic decompletion (ALRS Definition 5.2.23, p. 106, ALRS line 5648). Prove that for G × H, M^{(G×H)-la} = (M^{G-la})^{H-la} (ALRS Remark 5.2.25, p. 106, ALRS line 5659), that descendability of an equivariant map of solid ℚ_p-algebras does not depend on the action (ALRS Lemma 5.2.26, p. 106, ALRS line 5664), and the base change and semidirect product properties of ALRS Lemmas 5.2.27–5.2.28, p. 107, ALRS line 5691.

*Needs:* §10.3; §10.1.

The API has the following laws.

- M admits a locally analytic decompletion if and only if M^la ⊗_{R^la} R → M is an equivalence.
- For G × H acting, (−)^{(G×H)-la} = ((−)^{G-la})^{H-la}.
- An equivariant map A → B of solid ℚ_p-algebras is descendable in Rep(G) if and only if it is descendable as a map of algebras.

**Checks.**

- For R = ℚ_p with trivial action, M admits a decompletion if and only if M is locally analytic.
- For R = C(G, ℚ_p) with the regular action, R^la = C^la_G and R itself decompletes, since C^la_G ⊗_{C^la_G} R = R.
- For R = ℚ_p and M = C(ℤ_p, ℚ_p), M^la ⊗ ℚ_p = C^la(ℤ_p, ℚ_p) ≠ M, so M admits no decompletion over ℚ_p although it decompletes over R = C(ℤ_p, ℚ_p).

### 10.6 The sheaf of locally analytic functions

Let X be a Berkovich space with an action of G^cont for a p-adic Lie group G. Prove that the action of a profinite group on GSpec(R) induces a continuous action on R^u and lifts, after shrinking the group, along Berkovich-étale maps, uniquely up to further shrinking (ALRS Lemma 5.3.1, p. 108, ALRS line 5763). Prove that h = h_X: X/G^cont → |X|^Betti/G^la, where G^la acts on |X|^Betti through G^la → G^sm, is D-proper, and that pullback induces a fully faithful functor Mod_{O^la_X}(D(|X|^Betti/G^la)) → D(X/G^cont), where O^la_X := h_*O_{X/G^cont} is the sheaf of locally analytic functions (ALRS Proposition 5.3.2, p. 109, ALRS line 5814; ALRS Theorem 5.1.1(1), p. 92, ALRS line 4743). The introduction of ALRS phrases the same statement as primness of h with trivial codualizing complex (ALRS Theorem 1.19(1), p. 8, ALRS line 420).

A proof route: By Lemma 5.3.1 and 10.3 restrict to a compact open subgroup and localize on closed †-rational subspaces of |X|, so that X = GSpec(R) is affinoid; then X/G^cont and |X|^Betti/G^la are D-proper over GSpec(ℚ_p), since |X| is a finite-dimensional compact Hausdorff space and BG^cont, BG^la are D-proper (10.2, 10.3), and h is D-proper by cancellation. Full faithfulness on modules over h_*O follows from the projection formula for D-proper (hence prim) h.

*Needs:* §10.3; §10.2; §2.7; §2.2; §1.6.

**Checks.**

- For G trivial, h = (X → |X|^Betti) and O^la_X = h_*O_X, recovering 2.7.
- For X = GSpec(ℚ_p) with trivial action, h = (BG^cont → BG^la) and O^la = O by 10.3.
- For X = G^cont with G = ℤ_p acting by translation, h is not an isomorphism: D(X/G^cont) = D(ℚ_p) while |X|^Betti/G^la = ℤ_p^sm/ℤ_p^la carries more quasi-coherent sheaves.

### 10.7 Classical decompletion

Prove that for a Gelfand ring R with an action of a compact p-adic Lie group G, the connective cover τ_{≥0}R^la is a Gelfand ring (ALRS Lemma 5.4.1, p. 109, ALRS line 5831). Call R classically decompleted if R^la is connective and R^la → R is an isomorphism on uniform completions; call a Berkovich G^cont-space X locally classically decompleted if it has a strict closed affinoid cover by GSpec(R_i), stabilized by compact opens G_i with R_i classically decompleted, and let X^la = ⋃ GSpec(R_i^la) (ALRS Definition 5.4.2, p. 110, ALRS line 5851). Prove that X^la is a Berkovich space and that analytic, finite étale and Berkovich-étale sites of R^la, R and R^u agree (ALRS Remark 5.4.3, p. 110, ALRS line 5862; ALRS Remark 5.4.4, p. 110, ALRS line 5867), that Berkovich-étale G-equivariant R → R′ decomplete as B ⊗_{R^la} R = R′ (ALRS Lemma 5.4.5, p. 110, ALRS line 5877), that GSpec_{|X|/G^la}(O^la_X) ≅ GSpec(R^la)/G^la (ALRS Corollary 5.4.6, p. 110, ALRS line 5895), the stability properties of ALRS Lemma 5.4.7, p. 111, ALRS line 5909, and hence that for classically decompleted affinoid X = GSpec(R), R^la → O^la_X is an equivalence and Mod_{R^la}(D(BG^la)) ≅ Mod_{O^la_X}(D(|X|^Betti/G^la)), with every G^cont-equivariant affinoid Berkovich-étale GSpec(R′) → GSpec(R) classically decompleted (ALRS Theorem 5.1.1(2), p. 92, ALRS line 4747).

A proof route: Boundedness of τ_{≥0}R^la follows by adjunction from boundedness of C^la_G ⊗ R; †-rational localizations of GSpec(R) are pulled back from GSpec(R^la) because R^{la,u} = R^u (ABLB Lemma 3.1.8), and the sites agree by ABLB Proposition 3.2.11 for the Berkovich-étale maps of ABLB Definition 3.2.8 (ALRS Remark 5.4.4 cites the pair as Lemma 3.2.8 and Proposition 3.2.11).

*Needs:* §10.6; §10.5; §1.6; §2.6.

**Checks.**

- For K = ℚ_p^cyc with Γ = Gal(ℚ_p^cyc/ℚ_p), K^la = ℚ_p(μ_{p^∞}) is connective with completion K, so K is classically decompleted; this is the Berger–Colmez computation (BC16 Théorème 3.2).
- For trivial G every Gelfand ring is classically decompleted with R^la = R.
- For R = C(G, ℚ_p) with translation action, R^la = C^la_G and its uniform completion is R, so R is classically decompleted with X^la = G^la.

### 10.8 Integral binomial-analytic vectors and the ϵ-TORS criterion

For a Λ°-linear solid G-representation M define its integral binomial-analytic vectors M^{Bin_{r,ϖ}} = Γ(G, M ⊗_{Λ°} C_{r,ϖ}(G, Λ°)) (ALRS Definition 5.5.1, p. 112, ALRS line 5997). Prove that if a G-equivariant ϖ-complete solid animated Λ°-algebra A satisfies (ϵ-TORS) — there are 2 > r_0 > r_1 > ⋯ > 1, r_n → 1, with π_i(A^{Bin_{r_n,ϖ}}) ϖ^ϵ-torsion for i ≤ −1 — and a connective ϖ-complete A-module N admits maps N_{ϖ^{(d+1)ϵ}} → M ⊗ A_{ϖ^{(d+1)ϵ}} → N_{ϖ^{(d+1)ϵ}} composing to ϖ^δ with 0 ≤ δ < ϵ and M with trivial action, then N[1/ϖ] admits a decompletion by Bin_{r_n,ϖ}-analytic vectors, in particular by locally analytic vectors (ALRS Proposition 5.5.6, p. 113, ALRS line 6055); prove stability under relatively locally analytic base change (ALRS Corollary 5.5.13, p. 116, ALRS line 6203), define ϵ-TORS uniformly on G (ALRS Definition 5.5.14, p. 116, ALRS line 6213) and prove its stability under integral models of Tate-rational localizations (ALRS Lemmas 5.5.16–5.5.17, p. 116, ALRS line 6225).

A proof route: Tensor the given almost-retraction with the binomial-analytic functions and use the torsion bound on negative homotopy of A^{Bin} to make the comparison map an equivalence after inverting ϖ; the Lazard–Serre resolution bounds the cohomological amplitude by d.

*Needs:* §10.4; §10.5; §1.3.

**Checks.**

- For A with trivial G-action, A^{Bin_{r,ϖ}} = A and ϵ-TORS holds for every ϵ.
- For d = 0 (G trivial) every module decompletes.
- If for every r ∈ (1, 2) the group π_{−1}(A^{Bin_{r,ϖ}}) contains an element killed by no power of ϖ, then ϵ-TORS fails for every ϵ and Proposition 5.5.6 does not apply; strong decompletion requires the torsion bound.

### 10.9 Strong decompletion and perfect complexes

Prove the base change and locality statements of ALRS Lemma 5.6.2, p. 119, ALRS line 6348 and the decompletion of perfect complexes over strongly decompleted algebras of ALRS Proposition 5.6.4, p. 120, ALRS line 6444. Call an affinoid Berkovich G^cont-space GSpec(A) over Λ strongly decompleted if there are an open uniform subgroup G_0, a direct system of G_0-equivariant ϖ-complete animated Λ°-algebras A_i with A_i/ϖ discrete and A = colim A_i[1/ϖ], each A_i satisfying ϵ_i-TORS uniformly on G_0; call a locally classically decompleted X locally strongly decompleted if, for some compact open G_0, a G_0^la-equivariant epimorphism Y′ → X^la from a Berkovich space over GSpec(Λ) has pullback Y = Y′ ×_{X^la} X a disjoint union of strongly decompleted affinoids (ALRS Definition 5.6.8, p. 124, ALRS line 6730). Prove that strongly decompleted rings are classically decompleted (ALRS Remark 5.6.9, p. 124, ALRS line 6746), that for locally strongly decompleted X pullback gives Perf(X^la/G^la) ≃ Perf(X/G^cont) (ALRS Theorem 5.6.10, p. 124, ALRS line 6754), also after every G^cont-equivariant Berkovich-étale Y → X (ALRS Corollary 5.6.11, p. 125, ALRS line 6786) and after base change along filtered colimits of p-adically complete animated O_K-algebras (ALRS Corollary 5.6.12, p. 125, ALRS line 6824). The strong decompletion hypothesis is kept: the source does not know the general case (ALRS Remark 5.1.4, p. 93, ALRS line 4791).

A proof route: By Lemma 5.6.2 reduce to G^cont-equivariant perfect complexes on a strongly decompleted affinoid GSpec(R), R = colim A_i[1/ϖ]; a perfect complex descends to some A_i, where Proposition 5.6.4 (built on 10.8 and the almost isomorphism colim_r C_{r,ϖ}(G, Λ°) → C(G, Λ°) of Lemma 5.6.3) produces the decompletion; full faithfulness comes from 10.7.

*Needs:* §10.8; §10.7; §2.3; §4.3.

**Checks.**

- For G trivial the equivalence is the identity of Perf(X).
- For one-dimensional Γ and a finite-dimensional K̂_∞-semilinear representation W, the decompleted module is W^la = W^fin and K̂_∞ ⊗_{K_∞} W^la ≅ W (BC16 Théorèmes 3.2 and 3.4).
- The equivalence is not asserted for arbitrary continuous actions; only full faithfulness (10.6) holds without the strong decompletion hypothesis (ALRS Remark 5.1.4).

### 10.10 The Tate–Sen axioms and the arithmetic, geometric and mixed decompletions

Let Λ be a uniform Banach ℚ_p-algebra with pseudo-uniformizer ϖ, Γ ≅ ℤ_p with generator γ and Γ_k = γ^{p^kℤ_p}, and A_∞ = (colim_n A_n)^∧_ϖ for static ϖ-complete ϖ-torsion-free animated Λ°-algebras A_n with A_n/ϖ discrete. Assume the Tate–Sen axioms: for every k there is n_0 such that for n ≥ n_0 there are 0 < ρ_{n,k} < ϵ_{n,k} → 0 with Γ_k acting trivially on A_n/ϖ^{ϵ_{n,k}} and the cohomology of Γ(Γ_k, A_∞/A_n) concentrated in degree 1 and ϖ^{ρ_{n,k}}-torsion (ALRS Assumption 5.7.1, p. 126, ALRS line 6855). Prove that A_∞ satisfies ϵ-TORS uniformly on Γ for all ϵ > 0 and (A_∞[1/ϖ])^la = colim_n A_n[1/ϖ] (ALRS Proposition 5.7.3, p. 126, ALRS line 6875). Prove: (arithmetic) X = (1 + D̃^{<1,u}_{ℚ_p}) ∖ {1} with G = ℚ_p^× is locally strongly decompleted with X^la = (1 + D̃^{<1}) ∖ {1} (ALRS Theorem 5.7.4, p. 127, ALRS line 6930); the toric tower satisfies the axioms (ALRS Proposition 5.7.16, p. 134, ALRS line 7338); (geometric) for a perfectoid D over ℚ_p^cyc and G = ℤ_p(1)^d acting on X = D^×_{FF,G̃^{d,⋄}_{m,D}} = G̃^{d,u}_{m,ℚ_p} × D^×_{FF,D}, X is locally strongly decompleted with X^la = G̃^d_{m,ℚ_p} × D^×_{FF,D} (ALRS Corollary 5.7.18, p. 135, ALRS line 7371); and the summary: X_arith = D^×_{FF,ℚ_p^cyc} has X^la_arith = BC(O(1)) ∖ {0}, X_geo has X^la_geo = G̃^d_{m,ℚ_p} × D^×_{FF,D}, for X_mixed = D^×_{FF,G̃^{d,u}_{m,ℚ_p^cyc}} with G_mixed = ℤ_p^× ⋉ ℤ_p(1)^d one has X^la_mixed = G̃^d_{m,ℚ_p} × (BC(O(1)) ∖ {0}), and for every Berkovich-étale G^cont-equivariant Y → X_? (? ∈ {arith, geo, mixed}), Perf(Y^la/G^la_?) ≃ Perf(Y/G^cont_?) (ALRS Theorem 5.7.19, p. 135, ALRS line 7390).

A proof route: Lemma 5.7.2 shows that A_n is a C_{r,ϖ}(Γ_k, Λ°)-comodule for r below |ϖ^{−ϵ_{n,k}}|, which together with the torsion bound on A_∞/A_n gives ϵ-TORS. In the arithmetic case the affinoids of (1 + D̃^{<1,u}) ∖ {1} are covered by rings A_{∞,i} built from normalized Tate traces on the cyclotomic tower (the classical estimates of PadicPeriodRings §§1.3–1.4, extended to the relative rings by ALRS Lemmas 5.7.5–5.7.15); the geometric case uses the analogous traces for the toric tower; the mixed case combines them with Corollary 5.6.12.

*Needs:* §10.9; §10.8; §7.6; §6.1; PadicPeriodRings §1.3; PadicPeriodRings §1.4.

**Checks.**

- For d = 0 the mixed statement reduces to the arithmetic one.
- On the Hodge–Tate point the arithmetic decompletion recovers K^la = ℚ_p(μ_{p^∞}) for K = ℚ_p^cyc (BC16 Théorème 3.2).
- In the geometric case with d = 1 the generator γ of ℤ_p(1) acts by T^r ↦ q^rT^r, q = [ε], for r ∈ ℕ[1/p] (ALRS (5.7.10)); for r = p^{−n}, (γ^{p^k} − 1)T^r = (q^{p^{k−n}} − 1)T^r is divisible by ϖ^{1/p^{n−k}}, which is Axiom (1) of Assumption 5.7.1 with ϵ_{n,k} = p^{k−n} (ALRS Proposition 5.7.16(1)).

### 10.11 Decompletion of torsors

For a locally classically decompleted Berkovich G^cont-space X with h: X/G^cont → X^la/G^la, and a Gelfand stack Z over X^la/G^la, let β_{X,Z}: Map(X^la/G^la, Z) → Map(X/G^cont, Z) be precomposition with h and β^ét_{X,Z} its étale-sheaf version on the Berkovich-étale site (ALRS §5.8, p. 137, ALRS line 7454). Prove the permanence properties of ALRS Lemma 5.8.1, p. 137, ALRS line 7473 (stability under limits, the case Z ≅ Z^{dR/(X^la/G^la)}, Berkovich-étale locality), the comparison with arc-stacks for perfectoid X (ALRS Lemma 5.8.2, p. 138, ALRS line 7511), that torsors under groups !-locally induced by Gelfand rings are !-locally maps of Gelfand rings (ALRS Lemma 5.8.5, p. 139, ALRS line 7555), that O(T)^{G-la} = O(T^{st la}) for a decompleted H^la-torsor (ALRS Lemma 5.8.8, p. 139, ALRS line 7581), the symmetric double decompletion Y^{H-la}/H^la ≅ GSpec_{|Z|}(O^{(G×H)-la}_Z)/(G × H)^la (ALRS Proposition 5.8.9, p. 139, ALRS line 7595), and that β^ét_{X,Z} is an equivalence, when perfect complexes on all Berkovich-étale X′/G^cont admit decompletions, for Z = T^an × X^la/G^la with T perfect strongly Tannakian, Z = BU × X^la/G^la with U open in H(ℚ_p)^la, and Z = BΓ^la × X^la/G^la for a p-adic Lie group Γ (ALRS Proposition 5.8.10, p. 140, ALRS line 7627).

A proof route: For Z = T^an use the Tannakian description of maps to T^an (3.5) and the equivalence of perfect complexes; for BU and BΓ^la reduce to T = BH^an via the cartesian squares defining H(ℚ_p)^la; Proposition 5.8.9 combines Lemma 5.8.5, full faithfulness (10.6) and (−)^{(G×H)-la} = ((−)^{G-la})^{H-la} (10.5).

*Needs:* §10.9; §10.7; §3.5; §3.4; §2.8.

**Checks.**

- For the trivial torsor β_{X,Z} sends the trivial H^la-torsor on X^la/G^la to the trivial one on X/G^cont.
- For Γ finite, Γ^la = Γ^sm and Z = BΓ^la × X^la/G^la: β^ét is an equivalence by Lemma 5.8.1(2), since BΓ^sm is its own relative de Rham stack.
- A G^la-torsor over a Berkovich space need not be a Berkovich space: for G = GL_n(ℤ_p), Y ×_{GL_n(ℤ_p)^la} GL_n is the overconvergent neighbourhood of a closed subset (ALRS Remark 5.8.6), so Lemma 5.8.5 asserts only !-local affineness.

### 10.12 The decompletion theorem

Let X be a Berkovich space with a continuous action of a p-adic Lie group G, i.e. an action of G^cont, and h: X/G^cont → |X|^Betti/G^la. Then: (1) h is D-proper and h^* is fully faithful on modules over O^la_X = h_*O; (2) if X = GSpec(R) is affinoid and R is classically decompleted, R^la → O^la_X is an equivalence and Mod_{R^la}(D(BG^la)) ≅ Mod_{O^la_X}(D(|X|^Betti/G^la)), and G^cont-equivariant affinoid Berkovich-étale maps to X are classically decompleted; (3) if X is locally strongly decompleted, then every G^cont-equivariant Berkovich-étale X′ → X has a strict closed affinoid cover classically decompleted for the stabilizers, O^la_{X′} is the structure sheaf of a Berkovich space X′^la with |X′^la| = |X′|, and Perf(X′^la/G^la) ≃ Perf(X′/G^cont) (ALRS Theorem 5.1.1, p. 92, ALRS line 4738).

A proof route: Part (1) is 10.6, part (2) is 10.7 and part (3) is 10.9 together with Lemma 5.4.7 for the classical decompletion of Berkovich-étale covers.

*Needs:* §10.6; §10.7; §10.9.

**Checks.**

- For G trivial, X^la = X and all three statements are tautological.
- For X = D^×_{FF,ℚ_p^cyc} with G = ℤ_p^×, (3) gives Perf(BC(O(1)) ∖ {0}/ℤ_p^{×,la}) ≃ Perf(X/ℤ_p^{×,cont}), the decompletion used in 11.1.
- Without strong decompletion only (1) is asserted; in particular the equivalence on perfect complexes is not claimed for arbitrary continuous actions.

### Examples

For G = ℤ_p^× acting on X_arith = D^×_{FF,ℚ_p^cyc}, X^la_arith = BC(O(1)) ∖ {0} = (1 + D̃^{<1}) ∖ {1}. For K = ℚ_p^cyc with Γ = ℤ_p^×, K^la = ℚ_p(μ_{p^∞}), recovering Berger–Colmez. For G finite, G^la = G^sm = G^cont and every representation is locally analytic.

## Layer 11: The pro-étale comparison, Sen operators and torsors

This layer proves the comparison between the p-adic twistor stack and the relative Fargues–Fontaine curve: for p-adic fields, for rigid smooth spaces over perfectoid bases, and for smooth partially proper rigid spaces over a finite extension of ℚ_p, the headline theorem. It derives the computation of pro-étale ℚ_p-cohomology as coherent cohomology of the twistor stack, the comparison of Hodge–Tate stacks with v-perfect complexes, the arithmetic and geometric Sen operators and the inverse Faltings' extension, and the decompletion of pro-étale torsors under p-adic Lie groups with their Sen operators.

### 11.1 The arithmetic comparison

Let K be a finite extension of ℚ_p and X = GSpec(K). Prove that α_X: FF_{X^⋄} → X^{Div¹} is D-proper with O ≅ α_{X,*}O, so that for every map Y → X^{Div¹} pullback D(Y) → D(FF_{X^⋄} ×_{X^{Div¹}} Y) is fully faithful, and that for every Berkovich-étale U → X^{Div¹}, pullback Perf(U) → Perf(FF_{X^⋄} ×_{X^{Div¹}} U) is an equivalence (ALRS Theorem 6.1.1, p. 143, ALRS line 7756). Prove that for K/ℚ_p unramified X^{Div¹} ≅ GSpec(K) × Div¹ (ALRS Remark 6.1.5, p. 145, ALRS line 7873).

A proof route: Since K/ℚ_p is étale the square FF_{X^⋄} → FF_{Q_p^⋄} over X^{Div¹} → Div¹ is cartesian, reducing to K = ℚ_p. Then FF_{Q_p^⋄} = FF_{ℚ_p^cyc}/ℤ_p^{×,cont} (6.2), Div¹ = FF^la_{ℚ_p^cyc}/ℤ_p^{×,la} by 9.7 and 10.10, and α identifies with h of 10.12; (1) is 10.12(1) and (2) is 10.10.

*Needs:* §9.7; §10.12; §10.10; §6.2; §8.6.

**Checks.**

- On vector bundles, Perf(Div¹)^{VB} is the category of (φ, Γ)-modules over the Robba ring, and the equivalence restricted to FF_{Q_p^⋄} recovers the cyclotomic decompletion of PhiGammaModulesAndIwasawaCohomology §1.4 (cyclotomicDecompletionEquivalence) between ordinary and extended Robba (φ, Γ)-modules.
- Continuous finite-dimensional ℚ_p-representations V of Gal_K embed fully faithfully as vector bundles E_V on X^{Div¹}, with essential image those whose pullback to FF_{ℚ_p^cyc} has slope 0 (ALRS Example 6.1.7; VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB4 slope-zero-local-systems).
- The pushforward of E_V|_{X^HT} along X^HT → BG_m gives D_HT(V) as a graded K-vector space (ALRS Example 6.1.7(1)).
- On all of D the pullback is fully faithful but not an equivalence: for π: FF_{ℚ_p^cyc} → FF_{Q_p^⋄}, π_*O = O ⊗ C(ℤ_p^×, ℚ_p) with the regular action, whereas α^*α_*π_*O = O ⊗ C^la(ℤ_p^×, ℚ_p), so π_*O is not in the essential image of α^*.

### 11.2 The arithmetic Hodge–Tate stack and the arithmetic Sen operator

For K/ℚ_p finite and X = GSpec(K), prove that α^HT_X: X̂^⋄ → X^HT is D-proper with O ≅ α^HT_*O and induces Perf(X^HT) ≃ Perf(X̂^⋄), and that L_{X^HT/ℚ_p} = L_{X^HT/X} ≅ O_{X^HT}[−1]. Using the G_m^† ≅ G_a^†-gerbe structure of X^HT → X and Cartier duality, D(X^HT) is a module over D(G_a^an), giving each M ∈ D(X^HT) its arithmetic Sen operator θ_M. Prove: (a) for M in the essential image of α^{HT,*}, viewed as a solid C_p-semilinear Gal_K-representation, θ_M is the base change along K(ζ_{p^∞}) → C_p of the derivative of the Γ-action on α^HT_*(M)|_{K(ζ_{p^∞})} = Γ(Gal^cont_{K^cyc}, M)^{Γ-la}; (b) for static M in the essential image, H*(Gal^cont_K, M) ≅ H*(θ_M, M)^{Gal_K} (ALRS Theorem 6.1.3, p. 144, ALRS line 7798). Prove Tate's computation H^i(Gal_K, C_p(n)) ≅ H^i(X^HT, O{n}) ≅ H^i(K →^{n} K), with θ_{O{n}} = n (ALRS Example 6.1.4, p. 145, ALRS line 7868).

A proof route: (1) follows from 11.1 and the cartesian square X̂^⋄ = FF_{X̂^⋄} ×_{X^{Div¹}} X^HT, pushforward along the Cartier divisor X̂^⋄ → FF_{X^⋄} being conservative and preserving perfect complexes; (2) holds since X^HT → BG_m is †-formally étale and L_{BG_m} = O[−1] (4.8); for (a), over K_∞ the gerbe trivializes and the BG_a^†-action becomes the Γ^†-action, so θ is the derivative of the locally analytic Γ-action; (b) uses Γ(Gal_K, M) = Γ(X^HT, N) = Γ(Γ^sm, Γ(θ_N, N)) and exactness of smooth Γ-invariants in characteristic zero.

*Needs:* §11.1; §9.7; §4.8; §9.8; required contract `analytic-cartier-duality`; PadicHodgeTheory §4.4; FiniteFlatGroupsAndIntegralPadicHodgeTheory §R07.P7.2.

**Checks.**

- For M = C_p(n): if n ≠ 0, θ = n is invertible and H*(Gal_K, C_p(n)) = 0; if n = 0, θ = 0 and H⁰ = H¹ = K, H² = 0, Tate's theorem.
- On finite-dimensional C_p-semilinear representations θ_M is the Sen operator senOperator of PadicHodgeTheory §4.4 and the labelled Sen operator Θ = log ρ(γ)/log χ_p(γ) of FiniteFlatGroupsAndIntegralPadicHodgeTheory §R07.P7.2, with HT(χ_p) = +1.
- With the opposite sign θ_{O{1}} = −1 one would get H*(Gal_K, C_p(1)) computed by K →^{−1} K, still zero, but the Sen weight of the Tate twist would be −1, contradicting senOperator on C_p(1), which is multiplication by 1.
- L_{X^HT/ℚ_p} = O[−1]: the classifying stack BG_m^† of the band contributes the shifted dual of its one-dimensional Lie algebra.

### 11.3 Toric charts: the twistor stack as a locally analytic quotient

Let X = G_m^d over ℚ_p, X̃ = lim_{T↦T^p} X the perfected torus in Gelfand stacks and Γ_d = ℤ_p^{×,la} ⋉ ℤ_p^{d,la}. Prove that X^{Div¹} ≅ X̃_{X_cyc}/(φ^ℤ × Γ_d^la) = FF^la_{X̃^{d,⋄}_{ℚ_p^cyc}}/Γ_d^la, where FF^la is glued from the spectra of Γ_d-locally analytic vectors of Γ_d-stable affinoids of FF_{X̃^{d,⋄}_{ℚ_p^cyc}}, while FF_{X^⋄} = FF_{X̃^{d,⋄}_{ℚ_p^cyc}}/Γ_d^cont, so that α_X is the natural map from the continuous to the locally analytic quotient (ALRS Remark 4.10.15, p. 90, ALRS line 4683; ALRS (1.2.1), p. 8, ALRS line 399); the Lie algebra of Γ_d acts on FF^la through (log q)q∂_q, (log q)T_i∂_{T_i}, with logarithmic poles at the Hodge–Tate locus (ALRS §4.10, p. 91, ALRS line 4704).

A proof route: Theorem 4.10.13 (9.9) and its Frobenius-equivariant refinement (ALRS Remark 4.10.14) give G_m^{Div¹} ≅ G̃_{m,X_cyc}/(φ^ℤ × ℤ_p^{×,la} ⋉ ℤ_p^la); products give the d-dimensional case; the mixed decompletion of 10.10 identifies the quotient with FF^la/Γ_d^la.

*Needs:* §9.9; §10.10; §6.2; §8.2.

**Checks.**

- For d = 0 the statement is Div¹ = FF^la_{ℚ_p^cyc}/ℤ_p^{×,la} = X_cyc/ℚ_p^{×,la} of 9.7.
- For d = 1 the Lie algebra of Γ_1 acts by (log q)q∂_q and (log q)T∂_T, the factor log q being the derivative of a ↦ q^a; the action has logarithmic poles along the Hodge–Tate locus and is trivial modulo log q, and the residual linear action on the Hodge–Tate stack gives the arithmetic and geometric Sen operators of 11.2 and 11.5.
- The continuous quotient FF_{X̃^{d,⋄}_{ℚ_p^cyc}}/Γ_d^cont is FF_{X^⋄}, not X^{Div¹}: already for d = 0 the pushforwards of O from FF_{ℚ_p^cyc} to the two quotients are O ⊗ C(ℤ_p^×, ℚ_p) and O ⊗ C^la(ℤ_p^×, ℚ_p) (11.1), so the two quotients differ exactly by α_X.

### 11.4 The geometric comparison over a perfectoid base

Let D be a perfectoid space over ℚ_p and X → D a rigid smooth morphism of Berkovich spaces. Prove that α_{X/D}: FF_{X^⋄} → X^{Div¹/FF_D} is D-proper with O ≅ α_{X/D,*}O, so pullback from any Y → X^{Div¹/FF_D} is fully faithful, and that for every Berkovich-étale U → X^{Div¹/FF_D}, Perf(U) ≃ Perf(FF_{X^⋄} ×_{X^{Div¹/FF_D}} U) (ALRS Theorem 6.2.1, p. 146, ALRS line 7921).

A proof route: The statements are local on the target, so D = GSpec(A) affinoid over ℚ_p^cyc; by descent along †-formally étale covers (8.7) localize X in the rigid étale topology to X étale over G^d_{m,A}, and by base change and Künneth to d = 1; after passing to ℤ-covers the map is G̃^u_{m,D^×_{FF,A}}/Γ^cont → G̃_{m,D^×_{FF,A}}/Γ^la with Γ = ℤ_p(1) by Theorem 4.10.13 (9.9), and 10.12 with the geometric case of 10.10 concludes.

*Needs:* §11.3; §10.12; §10.10; §8.7; §9.9.

**Checks.**

- For X = D, X^{Div¹/FF_D} = X^{Div¹} ×_{D^{Div¹}} FF_D = FF_D since D^{Div¹} = FF_D for perfectoid D (8.3), and α_{X/D} is the identity of FF_D.
- For X = G_{m,D}, Γ = ℤ_p(1) acts on G̃_m by [T♭]^r ↦ [ε]^r[T♭]^r for r ∈ ℤ[1/p].
- The localization in the proof uses rigid étale maps and not †-rational localizations of X, because the latter are completed on X^⋄ (ALRS footnote 51, p. 146); accordingly the statement is made for Berkovich-étale U.

### 11.5 The geometric Hodge–Tate stack, Higgs fields and geometric Sen operators

For D and X → D as in 11.4 prove: (1) α^HT_{X/D}: X̂^⋄ → X^HT is D-proper with O ≅ α^HT_*O and Perf(X^HT ×_X U) ≃ Perf(X̂^⋄ ×_X U) for Berkovich-étale U → X; (2) L_{X^HT/X} ≅ Ω¹_{X/D}{−1}[−1]; (3) the BT^†_{X/D}{1}-torsor structure of X^HT → X and Cartier duality make every M ∈ D(X^HT) a Sym_{O_X}(T_{X/D}{1})-module, its geometric Sen operator θ_M, an Ω¹_{X/D}{−1}-Higgs field, which pulls back to the essential image of α^{HT,*}; (4) π_X^*π_{X,*}M is computed by the Higgs complex M → M ⊗ Ω¹_{X/D}{−1} → ⋯ → M ⊗ Ω^{dim X}_{X/D}{−dim X}; (5) every relative locally analytic orthonormalizable Banach Ô_X-sheaf lies in the essential image of α^{HT,*} and its geometric Sen operator is that of RCSen Theorem 1.0.3 (ALRS Theorem 6.2.2, p. 147, ALRS line 7976; RCSen Theorem 1.0.3, p. 2, RCSen line 64).

A proof route: (1) follows from 11.4 and X̂^⋄ = FF_{X^⋄} ×_{X^{Div¹/FF_D}} X^HT; (2) from the cartesian square X^HT → X over X/T_{X/D}{1} → X/T^dR_{X/D}{1} and 4.8; (3)–(4) from Cartier duality for BT^†{1} (RC26a, through the contract) and the relative de Rham complex of X → BT^†_{X/D}{−1}; (5) from the local description of RCSen §3.2 on toric charts.

*Needs:* §11.4; §9.2; §4.8; required contract `analytic-cartier-duality`.

**Checks.**

- For dim X = 1, L_{X^HT/X} = Ω¹_{X/D}{−1}[−1] and the Higgs complex has two terms M → M ⊗ Ω¹{−1}.
- A vector bundle on X^HT descends to X if and only if its geometric Sen operator vanishes, the analogue of p-curvature (ALRS Remark 6.2.5).
- For X = D the Higgs field is zero and X^HT = D.

### 11.6 The comparison with the relative Fargues–Fontaine curve

Let K be a finite extension of ℚ_p and X a smooth partially proper rigid space over K, viewed as a Berkovich space. Prove that α_X: FF_{X^⋄} → X^{Div¹} is D-proper and O → α_{X,*}O is an equivalence, so α_X^* is fully faithful on quasi-coherent sheaves, and that for every Berkovich-étale Y → X^{Div¹} pullback gives an equivalence Perf(Y) ≃ Perf(FF_{X^⋄} ×_{X^{Div¹}} Y); in particular Perf(X^{Div¹}) ≃ Perf(FF_{X^⋄}) (ALRS Theorem 6.3.1, p. 149, ALRS line 8082; ALRS Theorem 1.15, p. 7, ALRS line 356).

A proof route: As in 11.4: localize on X in the rigid étale topology (8.7; partially proper smooth rigid spaces are rigid smooth Berkovich spaces, 4.2 and 2.6) to X étale over G^d_{m,K}, reduce to the toric chart description 11.3, and apply 10.12 with the mixed case of 10.10.

*Needs:* §11.4; §11.3; §10.10; §10.12; §8.7; §4.2; §2.6.

**Checks.**

- For X = GSpec(K) the theorem is 11.1.
- For X = ∅ both sides are empty.
- The smoothness hypothesis is used: perfect complexes and cohomology on FF_{X^⋄} depend only on X^⋄, which does not see nilpotents (2.8), whereas the two sides of (1.2.2) differ for non-reduced Berkovich spaces (ALRS p. 9, ALRS line 483); so the theorem is not asserted beyond smooth X.
- For a smooth affinoid X the Hodge–Tate parts of the statement hold without partial properness (ALRS Remarks 6.3.4 and 6.4.2), but the statement for X^{Div¹} is asserted only for partially proper X.

### 11.7 Pro-étale cohomology as twistor cohomology

For K/ℚ_p finite and X a smooth partially proper rigid space over K prove Γ(X^{Div¹}, O) ≅ RΓ(FF_{X^⋄}, O) ≅ RΓ_v(X^⋄, ℚ_p) ≅ RΓ_proét(X, ℚ_p), where ℚ_p is the topological (condensed) ℚ_p and the last isomorphism is the comparison of the pro-étale site of X with the v-site of X^⋄ (ALRS (1.2.2), p. 9, ALRS line 480).

A proof route: Apply Γ to O ≅ α_*O (11.6). For a perfectoid S, RΓ(FF_S, O) = RΓ_proét(S, ℚ_p) by VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB1 (cohomology-of-twists) and these satisfy v-descent (VB1, v-descent-for-bundles-and-cohomology), identifying RΓ(FF_{X^⋄}, O) with RΓ_v(X^⋄, ℚ_p); the Gelfand quasi-coherent cohomology of FF_S agrees with the classical one by 6.2. The final comparison is the contract `proetale-v-comparison`.

*Needs:* §11.6; §6.2; VectorBundlesAndIsocrystals §VB1; AdicEtaleGeometry §A1.12; required contract `proetale-v-comparison`.

**Checks.**

- For X = GSpec(ℚ_p), Γ(Div¹, O) = RΓ(Gal_{ℚ_p}, ℚ_p) has dimensions 1, 2, 0 in degrees 0, 1, 2, with Euler characteristic −1 = −[ℚ_p : ℚ_p].
- For K/ℚ_p of degree n, H¹(Gal_K, ℚ_p) = Hom(Gal_K^ab, ℚ_p) has dimension n + 1, matching Γ(X^{Div¹}, O) through the cartesian square of 11.1.
- For connected X, H⁰(X^{Div¹}, O) = H⁰_proét(X, ℚ_p) = ℚ_p, the constants.

### 11.8 The mixed Hodge–Tate stack and the inverse Faltings' extension

For K/ℚ_p finite and X a smooth partially proper rigid space over K prove: (1) π_{X,1}: X^HT → X × K^HT is a BT^†_X{1}-torsor, so every M ∈ D(X^HT) is an Ω¹_X{−1}-Higgs module, compatibly with 11.5 after base change to perfectoids over Q_p^HT, descending the geometric Sen operator to X × K^HT; (2) L_{X^HT/(X×K^HT)} ≅ Ω¹_{X/K}{−1}[−1] and L_{X^HT/X} is an extension of Ω¹_{X/K}{−1}[−1] by O_{X^HT}[−1] whose pullback to X̂^⋄ is the inverse Faltings' extension, FE^−_X{−1} = L_{X^HT/X}[1]; (3) for G_FE = T_X ⋊ G_m with dual Lie algebra g*_FE, the pullback of g*_FE along X^HT → BG_FE is L_{X^HT/X}[1]; (4) the maps X^HT → BG_FE → B(Ĝ_FE ⋊ G_FE) → B(G^†_FE ⋊ G_FE) promote every sheaf on X^HT to a module over the enveloping algebra of g_{X,FE}, the analytic Harish-Chandra (Higgs–Sen) structure, restricting along T_X{1} → g_{X,FE} to the Higgs field (ALRS Theorem 6.3.2, p. 150, ALRS line 8145). Partial properness is not needed for these statements (ALRS Remark 6.3.4, p. 153, ALRS line 8277).

A proof route: Use the cartesian square X^HT → X over X/(T_X ⋊ G_m) → X/(T_X ⋊ G_m)^{dR/X} of 9.6, whose bottom map is Faltings' extension; the identification (G ⊂ G × G)^† ≅ G^† ⋊ G for a partially proper smooth rigid group G gives the Harish-Chandra action, and Proposition A.3.5 (4.8) computes the cotangent complexes.

*Needs:* §11.2; §11.5; §9.6; §9.5; §4.8; required contract `analytic-cartier-duality`.

**Checks.**

- For X = GSpec(K), Ω¹ = 0 and L_{X^HT/X} = O[−1], agreeing with 11.2.
- For X = G_m over K, the extension class of L_{X^HT/X}[1] pulled back to X̂^⋄ is the class of FE_X computed in 9.5, inverted and twisted by {−1}.
- L_{X^HT/X} is in general a non-split extension: splitting it would split Faltings' extension, which fails for G_m (9.5).

### 11.9 Locally analytic torsors on twistor and Hodge–Tate stacks

Let X be a smooth partially proper rigid space over ℚ_p and G a p-adic Lie group. Prove: (1) Map(X^HT, BG^la) ≃ Map(X̂^⋄, BG^la) ≃ Map(X^⋄, BG), so G^la-torsors on X^HT, G^la-torsors on X̂^⋄ and pro-étale G-torsors on X^⋄ are equivalent; (2) for every Berkovich-étale U ⊂ FF^⋄_{X^⋄}, pullback gives Map(X^{Div¹}|_U, BG^la) ≃ Map(FF_{X^⋄}|_U, BG^la); (3) there is a natural map Map(X^⋄, BG) → Map(FF_{X^⋄}, BG^la) sending X̃^⋄ → X^⋄ to FF^⋄_{X̃^⋄} → FF^⋄_{X^⋄} after perfectoidization; and the analogous statements hold relative to a perfectoid base D with X^{Div¹/FF_D} (ALRS Theorem 6.4.1, p. 153, ALRS line 8321). Part (1) does not need partial properness (ALRS Remark 6.4.2, p. 154, ALRS line 8349), and Γ(X^{Div¹}, O) = Γ(G^la, Γ(FF_{X̃}, O)^{G-la}) for a perfectoid pro-étale G-torsor X̃^⋄ → X^⋄ (ALRS Remark 6.4.3, p. 154, ALRS line 8351); whether X^{Div¹} = FF^la_{X̃}/G^la in general is not asserted (ALRS Remark 1.22, p. 9, ALRS line 460).

A proof route: The statements are local for the rigid étale topology, so X = G_m^d; (1) follows from Proposition 5.8.10 and Lemma 5.8.2 (10.11) with the explicit decompletion of X^HT (10.10), (2) from the toric description 11.3 and Proposition 5.8.10, and (3) by applying FF_− to X^⋄ → BG and composing with BG → BG^la.

*Needs:* §11.6; §11.5; §10.11; §11.3.

**Checks.**

- For G finite, G^la = G^sm and (1) recovers the equivalence between finite étale G-torsors on X and on X̂^⋄.
- For G trivial all mapping anima are points.
- For X = GSpec(ℚ_p) and G = ℤ_p, pro-étale ℤ_p-torsors are continuous homomorphisms Gal_{ℚ_p} → ℤ_p up to conjugacy, a free ℤ_p-module of rank 2, and (1) identifies them with ℤ_p^la-torsors on Q_p^HT.
- The identification X^{Div¹} = FF^la_{X̃}/G^la over BG^la is an open question (ALRS Remark 1.22) and is not a target.

### 11.10 Sen operators of locally analytic torsors

For a perfectoid D, a partially proper smooth rigid space X over D, a p-adic Lie group G and a pro-étale G-torsor X̃^⋄ → X^⋄ with decompletion β: X^{HT/D} → BG^la (11.9), define the geometric Sen operator θ^geo_β: g^∨_β → Ω¹_{X/D}{−1} as the shifted map of cotangent complexes β^*L_{BG^la}[1] → L_{X^HT/X}[1]; for X over K finite over ℚ_p define the mixed Sen operator θ^mix_β: g^∨_β → FE^−_X{−1} and, for X = GSpec(K), the arithmetic Sen operator θ^arith_β: g^∨_β → O_{X^HT} (ALRS Definition 6.4.4, p. 155, ALRS line 8384). Construct, for a †-formally smooth group G → S and a G^{dR/S}-torsor, the induced homomorphism of overconvergent groups (ALRS Construction 6.4.5, p. 155, ALRS line 8404), and prove that the dual of the resulting Lie algebra map Sen_β: T_{X/D}{1} → g_β is θ^geo_β and agrees with the geometric Sen operator of RCSen Theorem 1.0.4 (ALRS Lemma 6.4.8, p. 156, ALRS line 8454; RCSen Theorem 1.0.4, p. 3, RCSen line 113), and that for X = GSpec(K) and a Galois X̃ the dual of θ^arith_β is the classical Sen operator (ALRS Remark 6.4.9, p. 156, ALRS line 8471). Prove: for K_∞/K algebraic Galois with p-adic Lie group G and K^u_∞ perfectoid, β_*O = K^{u,la}_∞ is static and X^HT ≅ GSpec(K^{u,la}_∞)/G^la (ALRS Proposition 6.4.10, p. 156, ALRS line 8477); in the geometric and mixed cases, if θ^geo (resp. θ^mix) is surjective, then β_*O = O^la_{X̃̂^⋄} is static on a strict closed basis and X^HT ≅ GSpec_{|X̃|}(O^la_{X̃̂^⋄})/G^la (ALRS Proposition 6.4.12, p. 158, ALRS line 8545).

A proof route: Proposition A.3.5 (4.8) identifies L_{BG^la} with the shifted coadjoint representation, so Construction 6.4.5 gives the Lie algebra map; Proposition 6.4.10 uses that GSpec(K) → BG^la and GSpec(K^u_∞) → GSpec(K) are epimorphisms with t-exact pullback (K → K^u_∞ has a K-linear section and is flat by RJRC22 Lemma 3.21), so β is affine with static pushforward K^{u,G-la}_∞.

*Needs:* §11.9; §11.8; §11.5; §11.2; §4.8; §10.7.

**Checks.**

- For K_∞ = K(μ_{p^∞}), K^{u,la}_∞ = K(μ_{p^∞}) uncompleted, so Proposition 6.4.10 recovers K^HT = GSpec(K(μ_{p^∞}))/Γ^la as in 9.7; θ^arith is dual to the identity of Lie(Γ) = ℚ_p, the Sen operator of the cyclotomic character.
- For the trivial torsor g_β = 0 and all Sen operators vanish.
- For a torsor with non-surjective θ^geo, e.g. a torsor pulled back from a point, Proposition 6.4.12 does not apply and X^HT need not be the quotient of the locally analytic spectrum.

### Examples

For X = GSpec(K), vector bundles on X^{Div¹} are (φ, Γ)-modules over the Robba ring and Galois representations embed as those of slope zero. Tate's computation H^i(Gal_K, C_p(n)) = H^i(K →^{n} K) is the cohomology of O{n} on X^HT. For X = G_m^d over ℚ_p, X^{Div¹} = FF^la_{X̃^{d,⋄}_{ℚ_p^cyc}}/Γ_d^la while FF_{X^⋄} = FF_{X̃^{d,⋄}_{ℚ_p^cyc}}/Γ_d^cont.

## Layer 12: Twistor cohomology, duality, Chern classes and the Riemann–Hilbert functor

This layer extracts consequences of the comparison: !-ability of twistor stacks of locally †-l.c.i. maps; cohomological smoothness and the dualizing complexes of Div^{1,dR}, Div¹ and of twistor stacks of rigid smooth maps, giving Poincaré duality for pro-étale ℚ_p-cohomology; properness and duality for smooth proper maps; the prismatic first Chern class with the projective bundle formula; and the relation of formal Hodge–Tate stacks with Scholze's Riemann–Hilbert functor. The extended class of !-able maps built from Gestalten is not used: !-ability of finitely presented maps is restricted to analytically locally l.c.i. maps, as ALRS Remark 2.1.1(2) allows, and dualizing complexes are computed by the cone (ALRS Remarks 6.5.5–6.5.6).

### 12.1 Δ-!-able maps and locally †-l.c.i. maps

Call a map f: Y → X of Gelfand stacks Δ-!-able if f^{Div¹} is !-able (ALRS Definition 6.5.1, p. 159, ALRS line 8628). A map A → B of connective ℚ_p-algebras is finitely presented if π_0(B) is a finitely presented π_0(A)-algebra and L_{B/A} is perfect, and a map of Berkovich spaces is locally †-finitely presented if locally on strict closed covers it is a composite of †-rational localizations and analytifications of finitely presented maps (ALRS Definition 6.5.2, p. 160, ALRS line 8640); call it locally †-l.c.i. if moreover the analytifications can be taken to be regular Zariski closed immersions into overconvergent polydiscs D^{n,†}_X (ALRS Remark 2.1.1(2), p. 14, ALRS line 697). Prove: (1) a †-formally étale map whose perfectoidization is arc-locally lqfd is Δ-!-able, in particular pro-Berkovich-étale maps are; (2) A¹ → GSpec(ℚ_p) is Δ-!-able; (3) for a surjective map A → B of affinoid Gelfand rings of finite presentation as animated rings with L_{B/A} of amplitude [−1, 0] locally, f^{Div¹} is !-able and D-proper; (4) locally †-l.c.i. maps of Berkovich spaces are Δ-!-able (ALRS Proposition 6.5.3, p. 160, ALRS line 8649). Smooth and rigid smooth maps are locally †-l.c.i.

A proof route: (1) reduces by Lemma 4.2.5 (8.3) to de Rham stacks of Fargues–Fontaine curves (6.3). (2) covers A¹ by A¹ ∖ {0} and A¹ ∖ {1} and uses the presentation of G_m^{Div¹} of 9.9, !-ability of maps of Berkovich spaces and of classifying stacks of locally analytic groups. (3) by the cone square of 8.6 the twistor stack of a regular Zariski closed immersion is the base change of the deformation to the normal bundle, relatively affine over X^{Div¹}; regular Zariski closed immersions of analytic stacks are suave (RCSolid Lemma 6.3.5, through the contract). (4) combines (1)–(3).

*Needs:* §8.3; §8.6; §9.9; §6.3; §5.1; §4.3; required contract `analytic-stacks`; required contract `solid-serre-duality`.

**Checks.**

- An open immersion of Berkovich spaces is pro-Berkovich-étale with perfectoidization an open immersion, hence Δ-!-able by (1).
- The origin of the closed unit disc, the surjection ℚ_p⟨T⟩ → ℚ_p with kernel (T), has L = ℚ_p[1] of amplitude [−1, 0], so by (3) its twistor stack map is !-able and D-proper; the same holds for the zero section of A¹ locally on strict closed covers.
- Identities are Δ-!-able.
- The singular point of the cusp y² = x³ is a finitely presented closed immersion that is not l.c.i.: with m = (x, y), the relation y² − x³ lies in m², so L has H^{−1} = ℚ_p² and H^{−2} = ℚ_p, outside amplitude [−1, 0]. It is not covered by (3)–(4) here; ALRS covers it through 0-affineness in Gestalten (ALRS Proposition 6.5.3(3)), which is not used.

### 12.2 Twistor duality for ℚ_p: local Tate duality

Prove: (1) Div^{1,dR} → GSpec(ℚ_p) is cohomologically proper and cohomologically smooth with dualizing complex O⟨1⟩[2], the pullback along Div^{1,dR} = Q_p^HK → Marc(𝔽_p)^HK = GSpec(ℚ_p)/φ^ℤ of the line bundle of the isocrystal (ℚ_p, p^{-1}φ), shifted by 2; (2) β: Div¹ → Div^{1,dR} is D-proper; (3) Div¹ → GSpec(ℚ_p) is D-proper and cohomologically smooth with dualizing complex O_{Div¹}{1}[2], the (φ, Γ)-module of the cyclotomic character in cohomological degree −2 (ALRS Theorem 6.5.4, p. 161, ALRS line 8745). Prove that Q_p^Δ is cohomologically smooth with dualizing complex O{1}[2] (ALRS Remark 6.5.7, p. 164, ALRS line 8864).

A proof route: (1): Div^{1,dR} = ((1 + D̃^{<1,dR}) ∖ {1})/ℚ_p^{×,sm}; cohomological smoothness follows from the perfectoid disc (3.3(3)) and classifying stacks of locally profinite groups; the dualizing complex is computed representation-theoretically through BC(O(1))^dR/ℚ_p^{×,sm} → GSpec(ℚ_p)/ℚ_p^{×,sm} with modulus characters (HM Example 5.3.21) and Poincaré duality for de Rham stacks of smooth rigid spaces (3.3(2)), as in ALRS Remark 6.5.5, avoiding the p-adic monodromy theorem; cohomological properness follows from 3.3(1) since Div^{1,⋄} → Spd ℚ_p is proper (FS Proposition II.1.21; FarguesFontaineDiamonds §F2). (2): base change of A¹/G_m → A^{1,dR}/G_m^dR along the square of 8.6, a composite of maps represented in affinoids and of BG_m^† → GSpec(ℚ_p). (3): D-properness from (1), (2) and surjectivity of β; smoothness from 6.4(2) and the invertibility of α_*O (11.1); the dualizing complex by the cone square (ALRS Remark 6.5.6): ω_{Div¹} = f^!1 ⊗ f^*ω_{A¹/G_m} with ω_{A¹/G_m} = I, f^!1 = h′^*O⟨1⟩[2] by suave base change, hence O⟨1⟩ ⊗ I [2] = O{1}[2].

*Needs:* §9.7; §9.8; §3.3; §6.3; §6.4; §11.1; §8.5; §8.6; required contract `analytic-stacks`; required contract `solid-serre-duality`; FarguesFontaineDiamonds §F2.

**Checks.**

- With RΓ(Div¹, O) = RΓ(Gal_{ℚ_p}, ℚ_p) (11.7), duality pairs H⁰ = ℚ_p with H²(ℚ_p(1)) = ℚ_p and the two-dimensional H¹(ℚ_p) with the two-dimensional H¹(ℚ_p(1)), local Tate duality.
- Off the Hodge–Tate locus I is trivial, so O{1}[2] = h′^*O⟨1⟩[2] ⊗ f^*I restricts to h′^*O⟨1⟩[2], the pullback of the dualizing complex of Div^{1,dR} from (1) (ALRS Remark 6.5.6).
- ω_{BG_m} = O[−1] (Verdier diagonal trick: ω_Δ = O[1]) and ω_{A¹/G_m → BG_m} = I[1], so ω_{A¹/G_m} = I, the ideal sheaf of the universal divisor.
- If the dualizing complex of Div¹ were O⟨1⟩[2] everywhere, its pullback to FF_{Q_p^⋄} would be the slope-one line bundle rather than the Tate twist ℚ_p(1) (9.8), contradicting the dualizing complex of FF_{Marc(ℚ_p)} in 6.4(2).

### 12.3 Poincaré duality for twistor stacks of smooth maps

Let f: Y → X be a rigid smooth morphism of Berkovich spaces of relative dimension d. Prove: (1) f^{Div¹}: Y^{Div¹} → X^{Div¹} is cohomologically smooth; (2) for the base change f^{Div¹/FF_{X^⋄}}: Y^{Div¹} ×_{X^{Div¹}} FF_{X^⋄} → FF_{X^⋄}, its dualizing complex is f^{Div¹/FF_{X^⋄},!}O ≅ O{d}[2d]; (3) if X is a smooth partially proper rigid space over ℚ_p then f^{Div¹,!}O_{X^{Div¹}} ≅ O_{Y^{Div¹}}{d}[2d] (ALRS Theorem 6.5.8, p. 164, ALRS line 8875). Partial properness in (3) enters only through 11.6 (ALRS Remark 6.5.9, p. 165, ALRS line 8932).

A proof route: Cohomological smoothness is local on the source by 8.7, reducing to Y = G_{m,X} and then X = GSpec(ℚ_p), Y = G_m; there α_X is an epimorphism (11.1) and FF_{Y^⋄} → FF_{X^⋄} is cohomologically smooth (6.4(1)); since a: FF_{Y^⋄} → Y^{Div¹/FF} is D-proper with a_*O = O (11.4, 11.6), HM Lemma 4.4.9(ii) gives g^!O ≅ a_*(O ⊗ ℚ_p(d)[2d]) ≅ O{d}[2d], the Tate twist pulling back to the Breuil–Kisin twist (9.8). For (3) apply suave base change and the projection formula along h_X: FF_{X^⋄} → X^{Div¹}, D-proper with h_{X,*}O = O (11.6).

*Needs:* §12.1; §12.2; §11.4; §11.6; §6.4; §8.7; §9.8.

**Checks.**

- For d = 0 (f rigid étale), f^{Div¹,!}O = O: f^{Div¹} is cohomologically étale.
- For Y = G_m over X = GSpec(ℚ_p), f^{Div¹,!}O = O{1}[2]; composed with 12.2 the dualizing complex of G_m^{Div¹} over GSpec(ℚ_p) is O{2}[4].
- The statement is about the upper shriek f^! of the structure sheaf of X^{Div¹}, an object on Y^{Div¹}; the lower shriek f_!O lives on X^{Div¹} and for Y = P¹_X equals O ⊕ O{−1}[−2] (12.5), not O{1}[2].

### 12.4 Properness and duality for smooth proper maps

Prove that for a morphism f: Y → X of Berkovich spaces which is locally †-l.c.i. and whose underlying map of arc-stacks is proper, f^Δ: Y^Δ → X^Δ (and hence f^{Div¹}) is D-proper, so f^Δ_! ≅ f^Δ_* (ALRS Proposition 6.5.10, p. 165, ALRS line 8938, restricted to locally †-l.c.i. maps as in ALRS Remark 2.1.1(2), p. 14, ALRS line 697). Deduce that for a smooth proper morphism f: Y → X of smooth partially proper rigid spaces over ℚ_p of relative dimension d, f^{Div¹}_* preserves perfect complexes and f^{Div¹}_*(M^∨{d}[2d]) ≅ (f^{Div¹}_*M)^∨ for every perfect M on Y^{Div¹} (ALRS Corollary 6.5.11, p. 165, ALRS line 8952).

A proof route: D-properness is local on the target and, by the radius decomposition (8.5, Corollary 4.2.14), reduces to the Hyodo–Kato stack, where it is ABLB Proposition 5.1.4 (6.3), and to the twistor stack; for the latter take a finite closed affinoid cover Y_i → Y, whose disjoint union is a D-proper !-cover, and use that D-properness can be checked on universal D-proper !-covers of the source (HM Lemma 4.6.3(ii′), Remark 4.4.11(iii)). The corollary follows because pushforward along a cohomologically smooth D-proper map preserves dualizable objects (HM Corollary 4.5.18), with duality from 12.3 and HM Lemma 4.4.9(ii).

*Needs:* §12.1; §12.3; §8.5; §6.3; required contract `analytic-stacks`.

**Checks.**

- For f: P¹_X → X, f_*O = O ⊕ O{−1}[−2] (12.5); duality gives f_*(O{1}[2]) = O{1}[2] ⊕ O, the dual of f_*O, as the formula requires.
- For f the identity the statement is trivial.
- For smooth proper X of dimension d over K and its structure map, the formula pairs f_*O with f_*O{d}[2d]; over a geometric point C this is the perfect Galois-equivariant pairing H^i(X_C, ℚ_p) ⊗ H^{2d−i}(X_C, ℚ_p(d)) → ℚ_p of ClassicalAdicEtaleCohomologyPartII §5.9, ℚ_p(d) being the pullback of O{d} to FF (9.8).
- For the open disc over ℚ_p the underlying arc-stack map is not proper, f^{Div¹}_! ≠ f^{Div¹}_*, and f^{Div¹}_*O is not perfect.

### 12.5 The prismatic first Chern class and the projective bundle formula

Construct the first Chern class c^Δ_1: BG^Δ_m → B²V(O_{Q_p^Δ}{1}) of animated abelian group stacks over Q_p^Δ as the delooping of the composite of the connecting map G^Δ_m → G[1] of G^Δ_m = G̃_{m,Q_p^Δ}/G with log_Δ[1]: G[1] → V(O{1})[1] (ALRS Construction 6.6.1, p. 166, ALRS line 8992); it gives a weak theory of first Chern classes for X ↦ D(X^Δ) on Berkovich spaces with the Berkovich-étale topology in the sense of Zav Definition 5.2.4 (ALRS Remark 6.6.2, p. 166, ALRS line 9006). Prove compatibility with pro-étale Chern classes over the region (0, p), where O{1} is the Tate twist (ALRS Remark 6.6.4, p. 167, ALRS line 9032), and with Hyodo–Kato Chern classes over (1, ∞) (ALRS Remark 6.6.6, p. 168, ALRS line 9084). Prove that for every Gelfand stack X over ℚ_p and d ≥ 1, with f: P^d_X → X, the map Σ_{k=0}^d c_1^k{d − k}[2d − 2k]: ⊕_{k=0}^d O{d − k}[2d − 2k] → f^Δ_*O{d}[2d] is an isomorphism, so that c^Δ_1 is a strong theory of first Chern classes (ALRS Proposition 6.6.7, p. 168, ALRS line 9093; Zav Definition 5.2.8, p. 45, Zav line 1949).

A proof route: P^d_X → X is locally †-l.c.i. with proper underlying arc-stack map, so f^Δ is D-proper (12.4) and by proper base change X = GSpec(ℚ_p); by the radius decomposition (8.5) the claim splits into the Hyodo–Kato part (ABLB Lemma 6.2.9, 6.3) and the twistor part, which by 11.6–11.7 is the Galois-equivariant pro-étale ℚ_p-cohomology of P^d, computed by the étale projective bundle formula (EtaleCohomologyFoundations §0.9) through the proper algebraic comparison (ClassicalAdicEtaleCohomology §8.2) and the Kummer Chern class (§9.3) in the limit over p^n.

*Needs:* §9.9; §9.8; §12.4; §8.5; §6.3; §11.6; §11.7; EtaleCohomologyFoundations §0.9; ClassicalAdicEtaleCohomology §8.2; ClassicalAdicEtaleCohomology §9.3.

**Checks.**

- For d = 1, f^Δ_*O{1}[2] = O{1}[2] ⊕ O, the second summand generated by c_1 of the universal line bundle.
- For d = 0 the formula reads O ≅ f^Δ_*O for the identity.
- On the region (0, p), c^Δ_1 of a line bundle L restricts to the inverse limit over n of the Kummer classes c_1(L) ∈ H²(X_ét, μ_{p^n}) of ClassicalAdicEtaleCohomology §9.3, inverted at p; on smooth proper X/K this is compared with the de Rham class by CohomologyComparisons §6.7.
- With values in O⟨1⟩ instead of O{1} the class would not be compatible with Kummer classes over (0, p), since O⟨1⟩ pulls back to the slope-one bundle rather than the Tate twist (9.8).

### 12.6 Formal Hodge–Tate stacks and the Riemann–Hilbert functor

For a smooth rigid space X over ℚ_p prove that f̂: X^{HT^} → X^{cone^} ×_{Â¹/G_m} Q_p^{HT^} is a T^dR_X{1}-torsor, {1} the Breuil–Kisin twist, so f̂ is suave with f̂_♮1 = 1 and f̂^* is fully faithful; the same holds for the overconvergent version when X is partially proper (ALRS Proposition 6.7.1, p. 169, ALRS line 9143). Writing Q_p^{HT^} = Spf(K_∞[[t]])/ℤ_p^{×,la} and B⁺_dR = B⁺_dR(ℚ_p^cyc), prove that after base change along Spf(B⁺_dR) → Q_p^{HT^} the pullback f̂^* is fully faithful with essential image the sheaves whose pullback to X^HT_{ℚ_p^cyc} has †-nilpotent geometric Sen operators, and that vector bundles on X^{cone^/(B⁺_dR, t)} correspond to B⁺_dR-local systems on X_{ℚ_p^cyc} whose underlying Ô-bundle has nilpotent geometric Sen operator (ALRS Proposition 6.7.3, p. 170, ALRS line 9177). Construct the maps Spf(B⁺_pdR,X) → X^{pHT^} → X^{cone^} (ALRS Construction 6.7.5, p. 171, ALRS line 9223) and prove that pullback along F̃: Spf(B⁺_pdR,X) → X^{cone^}, restricted to vector bundles, is the base change along B⁺_dR,X → B⁺_pdR,X of Scholze's functor F(E) = Fil⁰(E ⊗_O OB_dR,X)^{∇=0}, the functor associatedLocalSystem of PadicHodgeTheory §7.1 (ALRS Proposition 6.7.6, p. 171, ALRS line 9237; Sch13 Theorem 7.6, p. 42, Sch13 line 1936). For X smooth over a perfectoid D with a lift X̃ to Spf(B⁺_dR(D)), prove that f^* is fully faithful from flat t-connections on X̃ relative to B⁺_dR(D), nilpotent modulo t, to B⁺_dR-local systems on X (ALRS Proposition 6.7.7, p. 172, ALRS line 9297).

A proof route: Proposition 6.7.1 is the base change of 9.6 along X → X^dR and Q_p^{HT^} → GSpec(ℚ_p), using X^{cone^,dR} = T^dR_X(−1)[1]. For 6.7.3, full faithfulness is proper base change; the essential image is detected on the special fibre X^HT_{ℚ_p^cyc} → X_{ℚ_p^cyc}/T_X{1}, where the BT^†_X{1}-action integrates to a BT_X{1}-action exactly when the Sen operator is †-nilpotent (Cartier duality for vector bundles, through the contract). For 6.7.6 replace the formal cone by the algebraic one (its Gelfandification, inducing an equivalence on perfect complexes) and identify F̃′_*1 = 1 with the filtered equivalence dR_X ≅ Rν_*B_pdR,X; Proposition 6.7.7 uses Remark 2.9.10 (5.3) to identify vector bundles on the relative formal cone with t-connections nilpotent modulo t.

*Needs:* §9.4; §9.6; §5.3; §11.4; §11.5; §10.10; required contract `analytic-cartier-duality`; required contract `algebraic-stacks-as-analytic`; PadicHodgeTheory §7.1.

**Checks.**

- For X = GSpec(ℚ_p) and E = ℚ_p with Fil⁰ = ℚ_p, F(E) = Fil⁰(B_dR)^{∇=0} = B⁺_dR, the trivial B⁺_dR-local system.
- The functor satisfies F(E[1]) = t·F(E) (PadicHodgeTheory §7.1, shift), matching the twist by the Breuil–Kisin ideal on the formal Hodge–Tate stack.
- For X = G_m over ℚ_p^cyc, the v-line bundle obtained from the ℤ_p(1)-torsor of p-power roots of T through a locally analytic character χ: ℤ_p(1) → ℚ_p^× with nonzero derivative has geometric Sen operator a nonzero multiple of dlog T (11.5(5)); this operator is invertible, hence not †-nilpotent, so the bundle is not in the essential image of Proposition 6.7.3.
- For any smooth X and E = O with the trivial filtration, F(E) = (OB⁺_dR,X)^{∇=0} = B⁺_dR,X by the Poincaré lemma, the counterpart of f̂_♮1 = 1 in Proposition 6.7.1.

### Examples

Div¹ → GSpec(ℚ_p) is cohomologically smooth with dualizing complex O{1}[2], and RΓ(Div¹, O) ⊗ RΓ(Div¹, O{1}[2]) → ℚ_p is local Tate duality. For P^d_X → X, f^Δ_*O{d}[2d] = ⊕_{k=0}^d O{d − k}[2d − 2k]. For X a point, Scholze's functor sends the filtered module ℚ_p to the B⁺_dR-local system B⁺_dR.

## Downstream consumers

No roadmap in the merge order consumes this one. Its interfaces are designed for: a Part II on the filtered prismatization and rational analytic syntomification of Hauck (Hauck, abstract, Hauck line 7), which needs Layers 4–9 and 12; an integral analytic prismatization with ℤ_p-coefficients (ALRS Remark 1.27, ALRS line 551), which would extend Layers 1–9; pro-étale cohomology and duality of p-adic curves and towers through the twistor stack, which needs 11.7 and 12.2–12.4; and a geometrization of the locally analytic p-adic Langlands programme along Pan's geometric Sen theory (ALRS Remark 1.23, ALRS line 472; Pan22 Remark 1.0.15), which needs Layers 10–11.
