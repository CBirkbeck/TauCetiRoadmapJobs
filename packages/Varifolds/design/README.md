# Roadmap: varifolds

**Summary.** This roadmap builds the general theory of k-dimensional varifolds on an open subset W
of a smooth Riemannian manifold (M, g), in the generality of Allard's theory as presented in
Chapter 8 of Simon's lectures: a varifold is an arbitrary Radon measure on the Grassmann bundle of
unoriented k-planes, and the analysis is carried out for varifolds of locally bounded first
variation. It starts from Mathlib's Radon measures, Riesz–Markov–Kakutani theorem, Hausdorff
measure, norm determinants and Levi-Civita connection, Tau Ceti's flows of compactly supported
vector fields, signed Riesz representation, Prokhorov theorem, divergence theorem and countably
rectifiable sets, and the approximate tangent plane, area formula and Grassmann-bundle material of
GeometricMeasureTheory and GeometricCurrents. Its end theorems are: the Riesz decomposition of
the first variation into generalised mean curvature, generalised boundary measure and outward
co-normal; the monotonicity formula, Euclidean and
intrinsically Riemannian, with the existence and semicontinuity of densities; Allard's
rectifiability theorem; the compactness theorems for rectifiable and for integral varifolds;
varifold tangents and rectifiable and integral tangent cones; the constancy theorem; the
comparison between the intrinsic theory on an embedded submanifold M ⊆ ℝ^L and the ambient theory
in ℝ^L; and the identification of GeometricCurrents' auxiliary varifold of an integral current
with the rectifiable varifold of its carrier. Every notion is defined intrinsically on (M, g); the
Euclidean space E is the case of the flat metric, and no isometric embedding theorem is used.

## Scope and ownership

Owned here:

- the projection presentation of the Grassmann bundle G_k(W) (each k-plane recorded by its
  g-orthogonal projection), its comparison with GeometricCurrents G6's unoriented Grassmann
  bundle, the varifold carrier, weight, mass, support, restriction, varifold convergence;
- approximate tangent spaces of Radon measures on a manifold and the rectifiability criterion for
  measures; rectifiable and integral varifolds v(Γ, θ); the multiplicity-one varifold [Σ] of a C¹
  embedded submanifold;
- push-forward of varifolds under C¹ maps proper on the support, Euclidean dilations and
  normal-coordinate blow-ups, tangent spaces with multiplicity, fibre measures and the first
  rectifiability theorem;
- the first variation δV, its characterisation as the derivative of mass along flows, stationarity,
  locally bounded first variation, the Riesz representation theorem for vector fields on W, the
  Riesz decomposition of δV, and the comparison of first variations for two metrics;
- the first variation of a C² submanifold and its agreement with RiemannianGeometry R5a.2; the
  intrinsic versus ambient comparison for an embedded submanifold M ⊆ ℝ^L;
- monotonicity (Euclidean and Riemannian), densities, their measurability and upper
  semicontinuity, the constancy theorem and the convex hull property;
- the semicontinuity of lower density bounds, Allard's rectifiability theorem, the compactness
  theorems for rectifiable and integral varifolds and Allard's multiplicity lemma, all for
  sequences of metrics converging in C² on compact sets;
- varifold tangents, rectifiable tangent cones and integral tangent cones, Euclidean and in
  normal coordinates;
- regular and singular sets, locality and isometry invariance of every notion, and the comparison
  theorem with GeometricCurrents G6.

Owned elsewhere and cited:

- Approximate tangent planes of rectifiable sets, tangential differentiation and the area formula:
  GeometricMeasureTheory G2. Countable k-rectifiability and its closure API, on any extended metric
  space and so on (M, d_g), are already in Tau Ceti (`TauCeti.CountablyRectifiable`), and the
  normalised Hausdorff measure is Mathlib's.
- Rectifiable sets and Hᵏ on manifolds with their chart comparison, integer-rectifiable and
  integral currents, their mass measures: GeometricCurrents G1–G2. The distributional constancy
  criterion (a distribution on a connected open set whose coordinate derivatives vanish is a
  constant multiple of Lebesgue measure): GeometricCurrents G1. Local area minimization of
  integral currents: GeometricCurrents G5.
- The unoriented Grassmann bundle (constructed from the oriented carrier by orientation quotient),
  its compactness over compact base regions and Radon compactness on it; the auxiliary rectifiable
  varifold of an integral current, its first variation under ambient flows, its monotonicity and
  tangent cones: GeometricCurrents G6. This roadmap proves the general theorems for arbitrary
  varifolds and one comparison theorem (9.3) identifying G6's object; nothing G6 states is planned
  again, and GeometricCurrents does not consume this roadmap.
- Immersion geometry, the second fundamental form B, the averaged mean curvature and the first
  volume variation of immersions: RiemannianGeometry R5a and R5a.2. The Hessian comparison for the
  distance function: RiemannianGeometry R4, item 1. Smooth second variation and stability:
  RiemannianGeometry R5b (not used here).
- The Riemannian distance, the exponential map, normal balls and the Gauss lemma: HopfRinow
  (Completed), Layers 0–2. The divergence of a vector field on a Riemannian manifold and the
  divergence theorem on boundaryless manifolds are already in Tau Ceti
  (`TauCeti.Manifold.divergence`, `TauCeti.Manifold.integral_divergence_eq_zero`).

Outside this roadmap: Allard's regularity theorem and every regularity statement beyond the
definition of the regular set (the subject of Varifolds, Part II); Wickramasekera's stable
regularity; Almgren–Pitts min-max theory; Brakke flows; curvature varifolds; varifolds with
respect to anisotropic integrands; varifolds in metric spaces; currents and their homology
(GeometricCurrents). The two Annals statements of 9.4 are consumers' theorems; they are stated
here only as tests of the definitions.

## Conventions

- **Ambient.** (M, g) is a smooth, Hausdorff, second countable, boundaryless manifold of dimension
  N ≥ 1 with a smooth Riemannian metric, presented through Mathlib's `ModelWithCorners`,
  `IsManifold`, `RiemannianBundle` and `IsRiemannianManifold`; d_g is the Riemannian (extended)
  distance of HopfRinow Layer 0. W ⊆ M is open. The Euclidean case is M = E, a finite-dimensional
  real inner product space with its flat metric (E ≅ ℝ^N by a linear isometry); there T_xE = E,
  ∇ = D and exp_x(v) = x + v. The integer k satisfies 0 ≤ k ≤ N; from Layer 6 on, 1 ≤ k ≤ N.
- **Planes as projections.** A k-plane S ⊆ T_xM is recorded by its g_x-orthogonal projection
  P_S, a self-adjoint idempotent of rank k (`IsStarProjection`, `Submodule.starProjection`,
  `isStarProjection_iff_eq_starProjection_range`). Distances between planes use the operator
  norm: for the lines ℓ_θ = span(cos θ, sin θ) of ℝ², `‖P_{ℓ_θ} − P_{ℓ_0}‖ = |sin θ|`, so two
  perpendicular lines are at distance 1 (the Frobenius norm would give √2; both give the same
  topology). The projection presentation depends on g; a change of metric is transported along the
  canonical identification of subspaces (1.2).
- **Measures.** A Radon measure on a locally compact, second countable Hausdorff space is a
  locally finite Borel measure (`IsFiniteMeasureOnCompacts`); such measures are regular
  (`Regular.of_sigmaCompactSpace_of_isLocallyFiniteMeasure`) and determined by their integrals of
  compactly supported continuous functions (`MeasureTheory.Measure.ext_of_integral_eq_on_compactlySupported`).
  Masses are extended nonnegative. Hᵏ is Mathlib's normalised Hausdorff measure
  `MeasureTheory.Measure.euclideanHausdorffMeasure` for d_g, which on a k-dimensional Euclidean
  space is Lebesgue measure; ω_k is the Lebesgue measure of the unit ball of ℝ^k (ω_1 = 2,
  ω_2 = π). Witness: H¹ of the unit circle of ℝ² is 2π and H² of the unit disc is π.
- **Balls and densities.** B_ρ(x) = {d_g(x, ·) < ρ}, B̄_ρ(x) = {d_g(x, ·) ≤ ρ}. For a Radon
  measure μ on W, `Θ^k(μ, x) = lim_{ρ↓0} μ(B_ρ(x))/(ω_k ρ^k)` when the limit exists, with upper and
  lower densities Θ^{*k}, Θ^k_* as lim sup and lim inf; open and closed balls give the same values.
  Witness: for μ = H¹⌞L, L a line of ℝ², μ(B_ρ(x)) = 2ρ, so Θ^1(μ, x) = 1 on L; for two crossing
  lines Θ^1 = 2 at the crossing.
- **Jacobians and push-forward.** For a C¹ map f between Riemannian manifolds and a k-plane
  S ⊆ T_xM, `J_S f(x) = normDet(df_x|_S : S → T_{f(x)}M')` (`LinearMap.normDet`, inner products of
  g_x and g'_{f(x)}); it vanishes exactly when df_x|_S is not injective. Witness: for f(y) = 2y on
  ℝ² and a line S, J_S f = 2; for f(y) = (y_1, 0) and S = span(e_2), J_S f = 0.
- **Dilations and blow-ups.** In E, `η_{x,λ}(y) = λ⁻¹(y − x)` for λ > 0. On M,
  `β_{x,λ} = λ⁻¹ exp_x⁻¹` on a normal ball of x, with values in the Euclidean space (T_xM, g_x); in
  E, β_{x,λ} = η_{x,λ}.
- **Varifold convergence** is convergence against every compactly supported continuous function
  on the Grassmann bundle (vague convergence). Simon's Chapter 4 convention, in which rectifiable
  varifolds converge when their weights do, is not used.
- **First variation and mean curvature.** `δV(X) = ∫ div_S X(x) dV(x, S)` with
  `div_S X = tr(P_S ∘ ∇X)`, ∇ the Levi-Civita connection. The Riesz decomposition is written
  `δV(X) = −∫ ⟨H_V, X⟩ d‖V‖ + ∫ ⟨η_V, X⟩ dσ_V`, with η_V the outward co-normal. H_V is the trace
  mean curvature: for a C² submanifold it is k times RiemannianGeometry's averaged mean curvature
  H = (1/k) tr B, where `B(X, Y) = (∇_X Y)^⊥`. Witnesses: the unit sphere S^k ⊆ ℝ^{k+1} has
  B = −g·x, averaged H = −x and H_{[S^k]} = −k x; the half hyperplane {x_N = 0, x_1 > 0} of ℝ^N
  has outward co-normal η = −e_1 along {x_1 = x_N = 0}.
- **Regularity classes.** For r ∈ {1, 2, …} ∪ {∞}, reg^r V and sing^r V refer to C^r embedded
  submanifolds; the class is part of every statement that uses them.
- **Lean carriers.** The Grassmannian of E is the subset of `E →L[ℝ] E` of rank-k elements
  satisfying `IsStarProjection`; the Grassmann bundle is the corresponding subset of the total space
  of the endomorphism bundle of `TangentSpace` (Mathlib's continuous-linear-map bundle), with the
  subspace topology; a varifold is a `MeasureTheory.Measure` on it with `IsFiniteMeasureOnCompacts`;
  test functions are `C_c(·, ℝ)`. All types live in a single universe.

## How to read the build

Layer 1 builds the Grassmann bundle in projection form, the varifold carrier and varifold
convergence. Layer 2 builds approximate tangent spaces of measures, rectifiable and integral
varifolds and the varifold of a submanifold. Layer 3 builds push-forward, dilations and
normal-coordinate blow-ups, tangent spaces with multiplicity, fibre measures and the first
rectifiability theorem. Layer 4 defines the first variation, proves that it is the derivative of
mass along flows, builds the Riesz representation for vector fields and the Riesz decomposition,
and proves the pointwise comparison of first variations for two metrics, which is the device by
which every Riemannian blow-up argument below reduces to a Euclidean one. Layer 5 computes the
first variation of submanifolds and compares the intrinsic theory on an embedded M ⊆ ℝ^L with the
ambient one. Layer 6 proves monotonicity, the density theorems, the constancy theorem and the
convex hull property. Layer 7 builds varifold tangents and proves the semicontinuity of lower
density bounds, Allard's
rectifiability theorem and the two compactness theorems, for metrics varying in C². Layer 8 shows
that varifold tangents are rectifiable or integral cones. Layer 9 defines regular and singular sets, records locality
and isometry invariance, identifies GeometricCurrents' auxiliary varifold, and states two theorems of
the literature in the language of the roadmap. Proof sketches name a route and its inputs; an
implementer who proves a target another way is not bound to the route.

## Layer 1: the Grassmann bundle and the varifold carrier

### 1.1 The Grassmannian of a Euclidean space

For a finite-dimensional real inner product space E and 0 ≤ k ≤ dim E, define the Grassmannian
G(E, k) as the set of continuous linear maps P : E → E that are self-adjoint idempotents
(`IsStarProjection`) whose range has dimension k, with the subspace topology and the metric of the
operator norm. The map S ↦ P_S = `Submodule.starProjection S` is a bijection from the
k-dimensional subspaces of E onto G(E, k), with inverse P ↦ range P
(`isStarProjection_iff_eq_starProjection_range`) (Simon1983 line 7295–7300, §38). The tangential
trace of an endomorphism A of E along P is tr(P ∘ A).

- G(E, k) is compact: it is closed in `E →L[ℝ] E` and every element has norm at most 1 (norm 1
  when k ≥ 1).
- P ↦ 1 − P is a homeomorphism G(E, k) → G(E, dim E − k), the passage to orthogonal complements;
  for P ∈ G(E, k), tr P = k.
- A linear isometry U : E → F induces the homeomorphism P ↦ U P U⁻¹ of G(E, k) onto G(F, k),
  functorial in U; in particular the orthogonal group of E acts continuously.
- For each endomorphism A of E, P ↦ tr(P ∘ A) is continuous (indeed linear) on G(E, k), and
  |tr(P ∘ A)| ≤ k‖A‖.
- For a finite-dimensional real inner product space F, the pairs (L, P) of a linear map L : E → F
  and P ∈ G(E, k) with L injective on range P form an open set, and on it the projection onto
  L(range P), an element of G(F, k), depends continuously on (L, P); L need not be injective on E.
  With Q = L ∘ P and Q* its adjoint, A = Q*Q + 1 − P preserves range P and ker P, is the identity on
  ker P and is invertible exactly when L is injective on range P (⟨Q*Qv, v⟩ = |Lv|² for v ∈ range P),
  and the projection is Q A⁻¹ Q*.

**Checks.**

- For the lines ℓ_θ of ℝ², `P_{ℓ_θ} − P_{ℓ_0} = sin θ · R` with R a symmetric orthogonal
  reflection, so `‖P_{ℓ_θ} − P_{ℓ_0}‖ = |sin θ|`; perpendicular lines are at distance 1, not √2.
- G(E, 0) = {0} and G(E, dim E) = {1}; a definition requiring only `P ∘ P = P` would put the
  non-self-adjoint idempotents `[[1, t], [0, 0]]`, t ∈ ℝ, into G(ℝ², 1) and lose compactness.
- diag(1, 1, 0) belongs to G(ℝ³, 2) and not to G(ℝ³, 1): the rank condition is on the range, and
  its trace 2 is the dimension.
- Under the complement map, the line ℓ_0 of ℝ² goes to ℓ_{π/2}, and tr(P_{ℓ_0} ∘ diag(a, b)) = a.
- For L_s = diag(1, s) on ℝ², L_s(ℓ_θ) is spanned by (cos θ, s sin θ): along s = 0, θ → π/2 the image
  line is ℓ_0 and along θ = π/2, s → 0 it is ℓ_{π/2}, so the image-plane projection has no
  continuous extension to (diag(1, 0), P_{ℓ_{π/2}}), where L kills the line. At (diag(1, 0), P_{ℓ_0})
  the map is not injective on ℝ² but is injective on ℓ_0: the pair lies in the open set, A = 1 and
  Q A⁻¹ Q* = P_{ℓ_0}, so a hypothesis "L injective on E" would exclude a pair that 3.1 uses.

### 1.2 The Grassmann bundle of a Riemannian manifold

Define G_k(W) as the set of pairs (x, P) with x ∈ W and P ∈ G(T_xM, k) for the inner product g_x,
a subset of the total space of the endomorphism bundle of TM over W with the subspace topology,
and π(x, P) = x. For M = E with the flat metric, G_k(W) is W × G(E, k) with the product topology
(Simon1983 line 7301–7305; AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025 line 151–156). Prove:

- π is continuous, open and proper, with fibre G(T_xM, k) over x; G_k(K) = π⁻¹(K) is compact for
  each compact K ⊆ W; G_k(W) is locally compact, Hausdorff, second countable and metrizable, hence
  σ-compact.
- A g-orthonormal frame on an open U ⊆ W gives a homeomorphism G_k(U) ≅ U × G(ℝ^N, k)
  commuting with π; G_k(W') = π⁻¹(W') is open in G_k(W) for open W' ⊆ W.
- The map sending an unoriented plane S of GeometricCurrents G6's Grassmann bundle over W to
  (x, P_S) is a homeomorphism onto G_k(W) commuting with the projections; through it G6's
  compactness over compact base regions gives the properness of π, and G6's Radon compactness is
  transported to G_k(W) (used in 1.4).
- An isometry f from an open set of (M, g) onto an open set of (M', g') induces the homeomorphism
  (x, P) ↦ (f(x), df_x P df_x⁻¹), functorial in f.
- For two Riemannian metrics g, h on W, the canonical homeomorphism G_k^g(W) → G_k^h(W) sends
  (x, P^g_S) to (x, P^h_S) for every subspace S; it is the identity when h = c²g with c > 0
  constant.

**Checks.**

- For M = ℝ² and k = 1, G_1(W) = W × ℝP¹ with ℝP¹ the circle of 1.1; for the round sphere S², the
  bundle G_1(S²) is compact (S² is compact and π is proper) although TS² is not trivial.
- For k = 0 and k = N the bundle is identified with W by x ↦ (x, 0) and x ↦ (x, 1).
- For h = diag(1, 4) on ℝ² and u = (1, 1), the h-orthogonal projection onto span(u) sends e_1 to
  u/5 and the Euclidean one sends e_1 to u/2: the presentation depends on the metric, and the
  canonical homeomorphism is not the identity on projections; for h = 4g it is.

compactness); Mathlib `IsRiemannianManifold`.

### 1.3 Varifolds, weight, mass, support and restriction

A k-varifold on W is a Radon measure V on G_k(W). Its weight ‖V‖ is the push-forward π_*V, a
Radon measure on W because π is proper; its mass is M(V) = V(G_k(W)) = ‖V‖(W) ∈ [0, ∞]; spt‖V‖ is
the support of ‖V‖, a closed subset of W. For a Borel set A ⊆ W, V⌞A is the restriction of V to
G_k(A); for an open W' ⊆ W the restriction of V to G_k(W') is a varifold on W' (Simon1983 line
7308–7317; AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025 line 157–160).

- Varifolds form a cone under addition and multiplication by nonnegative reals; the Dirac
  varifold δ_{(x,P)} has weight δ_x.
- Extensionality: two varifolds on W are equal when their integrals of every compactly supported
  continuous function on G_k(W) agree.
- ∫ φ d‖V‖ = ∫ φ ∘ π dV for every nonnegative Borel φ on W; ‖V⌞A‖ = ‖V‖⌞A.
- V is carried by G_k(spt‖V‖): V(G_k(W ∖ spt‖V‖)) = 0.
- Restriction to open sets is transitive and commutes with sums, with ⌞A, and with weights; a
  varifold is determined by its restrictions to the sets of an open cover.

**Checks.**

- The weight does not determine the varifold: on ℝ² with k = 1, H¹ on the x-axis lifted with the
  horizontal plane and the same measure lifted with the vertical plane have equal weights, and the
  test function χ(x)·tr(P ∘ diag(1, 0)) integrates to ∫χ dH¹ for the first and to 0 for the second.
- The horizontal lift of H¹⌞(x-axis) has mass 2 on the open unit disc.
- spt‖δ_{(x,P)}‖ = {x}; V⌞∅ = 0 and V⌞W = V.

### 1.4 Varifold convergence and compactness

A sequence V_j of varifolds on W converges to V when ∫ f dV_j → ∫ f dV for every compactly
supported continuous f on G_k(W) (Simon1983 line 7336–7338 and 7739–7740). Prove:

- Limits are unique; V_j → V implies ‖V_j‖ → ‖V‖ against compactly supported continuous functions
  on W.
- For compact C and open O in G_k(W), lim sup V_j(C) ≤ V(C) and lim inf V_j(O) ≥ V(O); the same
  holds for the weights on W; V_j(B) → V(B) for relatively compact Borel B with V(∂B) = 0.
- A convergent sequence has locally bounded mass: sup_j ‖V_j‖(K) < ∞ for every compact K ⊆ W.
- Compactness: every sequence with sup_j ‖V_j‖(K) < ∞ for each compact K ⊆ W has a convergent
  subsequence (GeometricCurrents G6's Radon compactness, through 1.2; Simon1983 line 1038–1045,
  Theorem 4.4).
- Convergence commutes with restriction to open W' ⊆ W and is local: convergence on every set of
  an open cover implies convergence.

**Checks.**

- δ_{(1/j, P)} → δ_{(0,P)} on ℝ, and not to δ_{(0,P')} for P' ≠ P in higher dimension.
- δ_{(j e_1, P)} → 0 on ℝ^N: the masses are 1 and the limit has mass 0, so mass is only lower
  semicontinuous on open sets.
- The horizontal and vertical lifts of H¹⌞(x-axis) alternate along a sequence with constant
  weights and no varifold limit; varifolds of lines through 0 at angles θ_j → θ converge to the
  varifold of the line at angle θ.
- j·δ_{(0,P)} has no convergent subsequence: the local mass bound is necessary.

## Layer 2: rectifiable and integral varifolds

### 2.1 Approximate tangent spaces of measures and the rectifiability criterion

For a Radon measure μ on W, x ∈ W and λ > 0, let μ_{x,λ} be the measure on T_xM given by
`μ_{x,λ}(A) = λ^{−k} μ(exp_x(λA))` for Borel A contained in λ⁻¹ times a normal ball of x (in E,
`μ_{x,λ}(A) = λ^{−k} μ(x + λA)`). A k-plane T ⊆ T_xM is the approximate tangent space of μ at x
with multiplicity θ ∈ (0, ∞) when μ_{x,λ} → θ Hᵏ⌞T against compactly supported continuous functions
on T_xM as λ ↓ 0 (Simon1983 line 2352–2362, 11.8).

- Rectifiability criterion: if μ has an approximate tangent space with multiplicity θ(x) ∈ (0, ∞)
  at μ-a.e. x, then Γ = {x : such T and θ(x) exist} is Hᵏ-measurable and countably k-rectifiable,
  θ (extended by 0) is Hᵏ-measurable and locally Hᵏ-integrable on Γ, and μ = θ Hᵏ⌞Γ (Simon1983
  line 2352–2364, Theorem 11.8).
- Converse: for Γ countably k-rectifiable and Hᵏ-measurable and θ > 0 locally Hᵏ-integrable on Γ,
  the measure θ Hᵏ⌞Γ has approximate tangent space T_xΓ with multiplicity θ(x) at Hᵏ-a.e. x ∈ Γ
  (Simon1983 line 2276–2301 and 2365–2374, 11.4–11.6, 11.9).
- Chart comparison: for a chart φ at x, μ has approximate tangent space T with multiplicity θ at x
  if and only if φ_*μ has the Euclidean approximate tangent space dφ_x(T) with multiplicity
  θ / J_T(dφ_x) at φ(x), J computed with g_x and the Euclidean inner product.
- Uniqueness: the approximate tangent space and multiplicity at a point are unique when they exist.

The criterion on a manifold follows from the Euclidean criterion through the chart comparison and
GeometricCurrents G2's chart comparison of rectifiable sets and Hᵏ; the converse is
GeometricMeasureTheory G2's existence of approximate tangent planes combined with approximate
continuity of θ.

**Checks.**

- μ = H¹⌞L for the x-axis L of ℝ² has approximate tangent space L with multiplicity 1 at every
  point of L, and 2H¹⌞L has multiplicity 2; since μ(x + λB_1(0)) = 2λ for x ∈ L, a normalisation
  by λ^{−k+1} instead of λ^{−k} would give λ⁰·2λ → 0, multiplicity 0 for both, and one by
  λ^{−k−1} would give λ^{−2}·2λ = 2/λ → ∞, blow-ups that diverge.
- Lebesgue measure on ℝ² with k = 1 has μ_{x,λ}(B_1(0)) = πλ → 0, so no approximate tangent line
  exists anywhere and the criterion does not apply.
- For k = 1, δ_0 on ℝ² has μ_{0,λ}(B_1(0)) = λ⁻¹ → ∞: no approximate tangent line at 0.
- Chart comparison: for φ(y) = 2y on ℝ² and μ = H¹⌞L, φ_*μ = ½ H¹⌞L, with multiplicity
  1/J_L(2·id) = 1/2.

### 2.2 Rectifiable and integral varifolds

For Γ ⊆ W countably k-rectifiable and Hᵏ-measurable and θ : Γ → (0, ∞) locally Hᵏ-integrable,
define v(Γ, θ) as the varifold A ↦ ∫_{Γ*} 1_A(x, T_xΓ) θ(x) dHᵏ(x), where Γ* is the set of points of
Γ at which the approximate tangent space T_xΓ of θHᵏ⌞Γ exists (an Hᵏ-full subset of Γ, 2.1). A
varifold is rectifiable when it equals some v(Γ, θ), and integral when moreover θ can be taken
integer-valued Hᵏ-a.e. (Simon1983 line 2861–2897, 7318–7326; AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025
line 166–175).

- ‖v(Γ, θ)‖ = θ Hᵏ⌞Γ and M(v(Γ, θ)) = ∫_Γ θ dHᵏ.
- v(Γ, θ) = v(Γ', θ') when Hᵏ(Γ Δ Γ') = 0 and θ = θ' Hᵏ-a.e. on Γ ∩ Γ'; the approximate tangent
  spaces of Γ and Γ' agree Hᵏ-a.e. on Γ ∩ Γ'.
- v(Γ, θ) + v(Γ', θ') = v(Γ ∪ Γ', θ + θ') with θ, θ' extended by 0; v(Γ, θ)⌞A = v(Γ ∩ A, θ).
- Characterisation: V is rectifiable if and only if ‖V‖ = θHᵏ⌞Γ for some such Γ, θ and
  V = ∫ δ_{(x, T_xΓ)} d‖V‖(x); integral varifolds are closed under addition.
- For k = 0, countably 0-rectifiable sets are countable sets, H⁰ is counting measure, and
  v(Γ, θ) = Σ_{x∈Γ} θ(x) δ_{(x,0)}.

**Checks.**

- v(L, 1) for a line L of ℝ² is integral; v(L, 1/2) is rectifiable and not integral.
- For k ≥ 1 and Γ countable, Hᵏ(Γ) = 0 and v(Γ, θ) = 0.
- Lebesgue measure on ℝ² lifted with the horizontal plane is a 1-varifold that is not rectifiable:
  its weight has no approximate tangent line (2.1).
- For two lines L_1, L_2 crossing at 0, v(L_1 ∪ L_2, 1) = v(L_1, 1) + v(L_2, 1): the crossing point
  is Hᵏ-null.

### 2.3 The varifold of a C¹ submanifold

For a C¹ embedded k-submanifold Σ ⊆ W with Hᵏ(Σ ∩ K) < ∞ for every compact K ⊆ W, define
[Σ] = v(Σ, 1) (Simon1983 line 2861–2867; EdelenSpolaor2023 line 130–131 uses the term
multiplicity one). Σ need not be closed in W.

- The approximate tangent space of Hᵏ⌞Σ exists at every x ∈ Σ and is the classical tangent space
  T_xΣ; hence [Σ] = ∫_Σ δ_{(x, T_xΣ)} dHᵏ(x).
- ‖[Σ]‖ = Hᵏ⌞Σ, which is the Riemannian volume `TauCeti.riemannianVolume` of Σ with the induced
  metric, pushed into W (GeometricCurrents G2's comparison of mass and Riemannian volume).
- spt‖[Σ]‖ is the closure of Σ in W; [Σ ∪ Σ'] = [Σ] + [Σ'] for disjoint Σ, Σ' whose union is a C¹
  embedded submanifold; for k = N, [W] has weight the Riemannian volume of W.

**Checks.**

- The unit circle of ℝ² gives a varifold of mass 2π with support the circle.
- For the open half-line Σ = (0, ∞) × {0} in W = ℝ², spt‖[Σ]‖ = [0, ∞) × {0} ≠ Σ.
- The image of a figure-eight curve is not an embedded submanifold at its crossing point, so [·] is
  not defined there, while v(image, 1) is a rectifiable varifold whose crossing point is H¹-null.

## Layer 3: push-forward, blow-ups and tangent spaces

### 3.1 Push-forward

Let W ⊆ M, W' ⊆ M' be open subsets of Riemannian manifolds, V a varifold on W and f : W → W' a C¹
map whose restriction to spt‖V‖ is proper (f⁻¹(K) ∩ spt‖V‖ is compact for each compact K ⊆ W').
Define f_#V(A) = ∫ 1_A(f(x), df_x(S)) J_S f(x) dV(x, S), the integrand being taken as 0 where
J_S f(x) = 0; in projection form (x, P) ↦ (f(x), P_{df_x(range P)}) is continuous on the open set
{J_S f(x) ≠ 0}, where df_x is injective on S = range P (1.1's image-plane continuity, in orthonormal
frames) (Simon1983 line 7443–7454, 39.1; AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025 line
188–195).

- f_#V is a varifold on W'; ‖f_#V‖(A) = ∫_{π⁻¹f⁻¹(A)} J_S f(x) dV(x, S); spt‖f_#V‖ ⊆ f(spt‖V‖), with
  equality when f is an immersion.
- id_# V = V, and (h ∘ f)_# V = h_#(f_#V) when f is proper on spt‖V‖ and h on f(spt‖V‖) (chain rule
  J_S(h ∘ f)(x) = J_{df_x S} h(f(x)) · J_S f(x)).
- For an isometry f, J_S f = 1 and f_#V is the measure push-forward along 1.2's homeomorphism.
- ‖f_#V‖(A) ≤ (sup_{f⁻¹(A) ∩ spt‖V‖} ‖df‖)^k ‖V‖(f⁻¹(A)).
- If f is proper on a closed set F containing spt‖V_j‖ for all j and spt‖V‖, then V_j → V implies
  f_#V_j → f_#V (the integrand J_S f · (φ ∘ F) extends continuously by 0 to {J = 0}).
- Rectifiable varifolds: f_#v(Γ, θ) = v(f(Γ⁺), θ_f), where Γ⁺ = {x ∈ Γ : J_{T_xΓ} f(x) > 0} and
  θ_f(y) = Σ_{x ∈ Γ⁺ ∩ f⁻¹(y)} θ(x), locally Hᵏ-integrable on f(Γ⁺); integral varifolds go to
  integral varifolds; for injective f, θ_f = θ ∘ f⁻¹; f_#[Σ] = [f(Σ)] for a C¹ embedding f proper
  on the closure of Σ in W.

The rectifiable formula is the tangential area formula of GeometricMeasureTheory G2 in charts,
transported by GeometricCurrents G2's chart comparison and the chain rule for J.

**Checks.**

- For f(y) = 2y on ℝ² and V = v([0, 1] × {0}, 1), f_#V = v([0, 2] × {0}, 1) of mass 2; the measure
  push-forward without the Jacobian would have mass 1.
- For f(y) = (y_1, 0) and V = v({0} × [0, 1], 1), J vanishes on the support and f_#V = 0; a
  definition ignoring J = 0 would place an atom at the origin.
- For f(t) = t² on ℝ and V = v([−1, 1], 1), f_#V = v([0, 1], 2): each s ∈ (0, 1] has the two
  preimages ±√s, consistent with ∫ φ(t²)|2t| dt = 2∫_0^1 φ.
- For V = Σ_{j∈ℤ} v({j} × [0, 1], 1) on ℝ² and f(y) = (0, y_2), f is not proper on spt‖V‖ and the
  formula would give infinite mass to the segment {0} × [0, 1]: properness is necessary.

comparison).

### 3.2 Dilations and normal-coordinate blow-ups

In E, V_{x,λ} = (η_{x,λ})_#V is a varifold on η_{x,λ}(W). On M, for r at most the normal radius of
x with B_r(x) ⊆ W, V_{x,λ} = (β_{x,λ})_#(V⌞B_r(x)) is a varifold on the ball of radius r/λ of the
Euclidean space (T_xM, g_x); for every compact set of T_xM it does not depend on r once λ is small
(Simon1983 line 7336–7338; 3407–3413).

- Scaling law in E: dη_{x,λ} = λ⁻¹·id preserves planes and J = λ^{−k}, so V_{x,λ} = λ^{−k} times the
  measure push-forward along (y, P) ↦ (η_{x,λ}(y), P); ‖V_{x,λ}‖(A) = λ^{−k}‖V‖(x + λA);
  (η_{x,λ})_# v(Γ, θ) = v(η_{x,λ}(Γ), θ ∘ η_{x,λ}⁻¹); (V_{x,λ})_{0,μ} = V_{x,λμ}.
- On M: J_S β_{x,λ}(y) = λ^{−k}(1 + o(1)) uniformly in S as y → x, and geodesic balls about x are
  the images of Euclidean balls (HopfRinow Layer 2), so ‖V_{x,λ}‖(B_ρ(0)) = λ^{−k}(1 + o(1))‖V‖(B_{λρ}(x))
  as λ ↓ 0, for fixed ρ.
- V ↦ V_{x,λ} is continuous for varifold convergence, and commutes with sums and restriction.

**Checks.**

- For V = v([0, 1] × {0}, 1) in ℝ², V_{0,λ} = v([0, λ⁻¹] × {0}, 1) of mass λ⁻¹ = λ^{−k} M(V) with
  k = 1; the measure push-forward without the factor λ^{−k} would keep mass 1.
- For a line L through x in E, V_{x,λ} = v(L − x, 1) for all λ.
- On the unit sphere S² with x the north pole and V the varifold of a great circle through x,
  exp_x⁻¹ is an isometry of the circle onto a diameter of the normal disc, so
  ‖V_{x,λ}‖(B_ρ(0)) = 2ρ exactly for λρ < π.

(Simon1983 line 7336–7338, 3407–3413.) *Needs:* Layer 3.1; HopfRinow Layers 1–2 (exponential map,
normal balls, local distance identity).

### 3.3 Tangent spaces with multiplicity, fibre measures and the first rectifiability theorem

V has tangent space T ∈ G(T_xM, k) with multiplicity θ ∈ (0, ∞) at x when V_{x,λ} → θ v(T, 1) as
λ ↓ 0, as varifolds on T_xM (Simon1983 line 7333–7338, 38.1).

- If V has tangent space T with multiplicity θ at x, then ‖V‖ has approximate tangent space T with
  multiplicity θ at x (Simon1983 line 7339–7341, 38.2); tangent spaces and multiplicities are
  unique.
- Fibre measures: there is a ‖V‖-measurable family x ↦ ν^x of Borel probability measures on
  G(T_xM, k), unique ‖V‖-a.e., with ∫ f dV = ∫∫ f(x, S) dν^x(S) d‖V‖(x) for every nonnegative Borel
  f. In E, for ‖V‖-a.e. x and every compactly supported continuous f on G_k(W),
  `‖V‖(B_ρ(x))⁻¹ ∫_{G_k(B_ρ(x))} f dV → ∫ f(x, S) dν^x(S)` as ρ ↓ 0 (Simon1983 line 7352–7368, 38.4);
  on M the same limit holds at ‖V‖-a.e. point of the (Borel) set D where Θ^k(‖V‖, x) exists and
  lies in (0, ∞).
- First rectifiability theorem: if V has a tangent space T_x with multiplicity θ(x) ∈ (0, ∞) at
  ‖V‖-a.e. x, then Γ = {x : T_x and θ(x) exist} is Hᵏ-measurable and countably k-rectifiable,
  θ is locally Hᵏ-integrable on Γ, and V = v(Γ, θ) (Simon1983 line 7342–7349, 38.3).
- Conversely v(Γ, θ) has tangent space T_xΓ with multiplicity θ(x) at Hᵏ-a.e. x ∈ Γ.

The fibre measures come from `MeasureTheory.Measure.condKernel` in g-orthonormal trivialisations
(1.2) of the finite restrictions of V to compact sets; the ball limits come from
`VitaliFamily.ae_tendsto_average` for `Besicovitch.vitaliFamily` in E. On M they come from
`VitaliFamily.ae_tendsto_average` for `Vitali.vitaliFamily` on a Borel set D' ⊆ D with
‖V‖(D ∖ D') = 0, with the distance min(d_g, 1) (same small balls as d_g) and the measure ‖V‖⌞D',
where every point x of D' is a density point of D for geodesic balls:
‖V‖(B̄_r(x) ∖ D) = o(‖V‖(B̄_r(x))) as r ↓ 0. Such a D' exists: in a chart,
`Besicovitch.ae_tendsto_measure_inter_div_of_measurableSet` for the image of ‖V‖ makes ‖V‖-a.e.
x ∈ D a density point of D for chart balls; for a constant c ≥ 1 and small r, the geodesic ball
B̄_r(x) lies in the chart ball of radius cr, which lies in B̄_{c²r}(x), and
‖V‖(B̄_{c²r}(x)) ≤ (c^{2k} + 1)‖V‖(B̄_r(x)) because Θ^k(‖V‖, x) ∈ (0, ∞). At x ∈ D' the ratio
(‖V‖⌞D')(B̄_{3r}(x)) / (‖V‖⌞D')(B̄_r(x)) tends to 3^k, so the doubling hypothesis holds with
C = 3^k + 1 for every small r; the averages over B̄_r(x) ∩ D' and over B̄_r(x) differ by o(1)
because the integrand y ↦ ∫ f(y, S) dν^y(S) is bounded. The density points cannot be replaced by D
itself: on ℝ² with k = 1, L the x-axis and ‖V‖ the sum of |y_1| H¹⌞L and the measure of density
|y|⁻¹ with respect to Lebesgue measure, ‖V‖(B_r(0)) = r² + 2πr, so Θ^1(‖V‖, 0) = π and D = L, while
(‖V‖⌞D)(B̄_{3r}(0)) = 9r² = 9 (‖V‖⌞D)(B̄_r(0)) for every r > 0; with the weight e^{−1/|y_1|} in
place of |y_1| the ratio is at least e^{1/(2r)}, so no constant C serves on D. The theorem follows
from 2.1's criterion and the fibre measures (Simon1983 line 7419–7440).

**Checks.**

- For V = v(L_1, 1) + v(L_2, 1), two lines of ℝ² crossing at 0, V_{0,λ} = V for every λ and V is not
  of the form θv(T, 1), so V has no tangent space at 0 but has one at every other point of its
  support.
- Lebesgue measure on ℝ² lifted with the horizontal plane (k = 1) has ‖V_{x,λ}‖(B_1(0)) = πλ → 0:
  no tangent space anywhere.
- The vertical lift of H¹⌞(x-axis) has weights with approximate tangent space the x-axis, but
  V_{x,λ} converges to the vertical lift of H¹ on the axis, which is not θ v(T, 1): a tangent space of
  the varifold is a stronger requirement than an approximate tangent space of its weight.
- For V = v(L, 1), ν^x = δ_{P_L} at every x ∈ L.

## Layer 4: the first variation

### 4.1 Tangential divergence and the first variation

For a C¹ vector field X on W, x ∈ W and S ∈ G(T_xM, k), define div_S X(x) = tr(P_S ∘ ∇X(x)) =
Σ_i g(∇_{τ_i} X, τ_i) for a g_x-orthonormal basis τ_1, …, τ_k of S, with ∇ the Levi-Civita connection
(`CovariantDerivative.leviCivitaConnection`; in E, ∇X = DX). For a varifold V on W and X of class C¹
with compact support in W, define δV(X) = ∫ div_S X(x) dV(x, S) (Simon1983 line 7455–7473, 39.2;
AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025 line 179–187; Scharrer2022 line 87–98).

- (x, S) ↦ div_S X(x) is continuous with compact support in G_k(spt X), so δV(X) is finite;
  δV is linear in X, additive and positively homogeneous in V, and
  |δV(X)| ≤ k ‖V‖(K) sup_K |∇X| for spt X ⊆ K.
- Locality: δV(X) = 0 when X vanishes on an open set containing spt‖V‖ ∩ spt X; for open W' ⊆ W
  and spt X ⊆ W', the restriction of V to W' has first variation δV(X).
- Continuity: V_j → V implies δV_j(X) → δV(X) for every such X.
- Degenerate dimensions: for k = 0, δV = 0; for k = N, G(T_xM, N) = {1} and δV(X) = ∫ div X d‖V‖
  with div X = tr(∇X) the Riemannian divergence `TauCeti.Manifold.divergence`.
- Derivative of mass: let φ_t be the flow of X (`TauCeti.globalFlow`, complete by
  `TauCeti.isCompleteVectorField_of_isCompact_of_eq_zero_off`) and K ⊆ W compact with spt X ⊆ K. Then
  t ↦ ‖(φ_t)_#V‖(K) is differentiable at every t, with derivative δ((φ_t)_#V)(X), and equal to
  δV(X) at t = 0 (Simon1983 line 7455–7462, 1860–1956, 9.1–9.3; AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025
  line 210–212, Proposition 2.6).

Route for the derivative: φ_t is the identity off spt X and maps K onto K, so
‖(φ_t)_#V‖(K) = ∫_{G_k(K)} J_S φ_t(x) dV(x, S); the derivative of φ_t^*g at t = 0 is the Lie derivative
L_X g, with (L_X g)(u, v) = g(∇_u X, v) + g(u, ∇_v X) for the Levi-Civita connection, so
∂_t J_S φ_t(x)|_{t=0} = div_S X(x) uniformly on G_k(K), and dominated convergence applies.

**Checks.**

- For the unit circle C of ℝ² and X = ψ(y)·y with ψ = 1 near C, div_{T_yC} X = 1, so δ[C](X) = 2π;
  the flow dilates C to the circle of radius e^t, whose length 2πe^t has derivative 2π at 0.
- For V = v(L, 1), L the x-axis of ℝ², and X = ψ(y)e_2, div_L X = ∂_1 X^1 = 0, so δV(X) = 0.

### 4.2 Stationary varifolds and locally bounded first variation

V is stationary in W when δV(X) = 0 for every C¹ vector field X with compact support in W. V has
locally bounded first variation in W when for each compact K ⊆ W there is C_K with
|δV(X)| ≤ C_K sup |X| for every such X with spt X ⊆ K (Simon1983 line 7474–7486, 39.3;
AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025 line 264–268). Prove:

- If V has locally bounded first variation, δV extends uniquely to a linear functional on compactly
  supported continuous vector fields with the same local bounds, and the total variation ‖δV‖
  given by 4.3 is a Radon measure with ‖δV‖(U) = sup{δV(X) : |X| ≤ 1, spt X ⊆ U} for open U ⊆ W.
- spt‖δV‖ ⊆ spt‖V‖; the extended δV(X) depends only on X restricted to spt‖V‖; ‖δ(V + V')‖ ≤
  ‖δV‖ + ‖δV'‖; ‖δ(cV)‖ = c‖δV‖; restriction to open W' gives the restriction of ‖δV‖.
- Lower semicontinuity: if V_j → V and lim inf_j ‖δV_j‖(U) < ∞ for every open U with compact
  closure in W, then V has locally bounded first variation and ‖δV‖(U) ≤ lim inf_j ‖δV_j‖(U) for
  such U (Simon1983 line 7580–7583, 40.7(1)); limits of stationary varifolds are stationary.

**Checks.**

- v(L, 1) for a line L of ℝ^N is stationary; for the unit circle, ‖δ[C]‖ = H¹⌞C.
- The vertical lift V of H¹⌞(x-axis) does not have locally bounded first variation: X_n =
  n⁻¹ψ(y) sin(n y_2) e_2 has sup |X_n| ≤ n⁻¹ and δV(X_n) = ∫ ψ(t, 0) dt for all n.
- The Riemannian volume of W (k = N) is stationary; Lebesgue measure on ℝ² lifted with a constant
  line P (k = 1) is stationary, since δV(X) = ∫ tr(P DX) dy = 0 by integration by parts.

(Simon1983 line 7474–7486, 7580–7583.) *Needs:* Layer 4.1, Layer 4.3.

### 4.3 Riesz representation for vector fields

Let L be a linear functional on the compactly supported continuous vector fields on W such that
sup{L(X) : |X| ≤ 1, spt X ⊆ K} < ∞ for each compact K ⊆ W. Then there are a unique Radon measure ‖L‖
on W and a ‖L‖-measurable vector field η with |η| = 1 ‖L‖-a.e. such that L(X) = ∫ ⟨η, X⟩ d‖L‖ for
all such X, and ‖L‖(U) = sup{L(X) : |X| ≤ 1, spt X ⊆ U} for every open U ⊆ W; η is unique ‖L‖-a.e.
(Simon1983 line 857–882, 4.1–4.2).

Route: on an open set with a g-orthonormal frame e_1, …, e_N, the scalar functionals
φ ↦ L(φ e_i) are order bounded on `C_c(U, ℝ)` and are differences of Riesz measures
(`TauCeti.RealRMK.posPart`, `TauCeti.RealRMK.negPart`, `RealRMK.rieszMeasure`); the vector measure
they form has total variation ‖L‖ on U and polar density η (`Measure.rnDeriv` of the components with
respect to ‖L‖); uniqueness glues the local constructions over a countable cover.

**Checks.**

- On ℝ^N, L(X) = ⟨X(0), v⟩ gives ‖L‖ = |v| δ_0 and η(0) = v/|v|.
- L(X) = ∫_0^1 X^1(t, 0) dt − ∫_0^1 X^1(t, 0) dt is zero, so ‖L‖ = 0; adding the total variations of
  the two terms would give 2H¹⌞([0, 1] × {0}).
- L(X) = ∫ (X^1 + X^2) dy on ℝ² gives ‖L‖ = √2 times Lebesgue measure and η = (e_1 + e_2)/√2; a
  coordinatewise total variation would give twice Lebesgue measure.

### 4.4 The Riesz decomposition of the first variation

Let V have locally bounded first variation in W. There are H_V ∈ L¹_loc(‖V‖; TM), a ‖V‖-null Borel
set Z_V ⊆ W, the measure σ_V = ‖δV‖⌞Z_V and a σ_V-measurable η_V with |η_V| = 1 σ_V-a.e., such that

`δV(X) = −∫ ⟨H_V, X⟩ d‖V‖ + ∫ ⟨η_V, X⟩ dσ_V`

for every compactly supported continuous X, and ‖δV‖ = |H_V| ‖V‖ + σ_V. H_V is unique ‖V‖-a.e., σ_V
is unique, η_V is unique σ_V-a.e. H_V is the generalised mean curvature, Z_V a generalised boundary,
σ_V the generalised boundary measure and η_V the generalised outward co-normal (Simon1983 line
7486–7509, 39.3–39.4; AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025 line 269–303).

- V is stationary in W if and only if H_V = 0 ‖V‖-a.e. and σ_V = 0.
- |H_V| ≤ Λ ‖V‖-a.e. and σ_V = 0 hold if and only if |δV(X)| ≤ Λ ∫ |X| d‖V‖ for all X; then
  ‖δV‖ ≤ Λ‖V‖.
- Isometries: for an isometry f, H_{f_#V}(f(x)) = df_x(H_V(x)), σ_{f_#V} = f_*σ_V and η is transported
  by df.
- Dilations in E: δ(V_{x,λ})(Y) = λ^{1−k} δV(Y ∘ η_{x,λ}), ‖δV_{x,λ}‖(A) = λ^{1−k}‖δV‖(x + λA),
  H_{V_{x,λ}}(η_{x,λ}(y)) = λ H_V(y), σ_{V_{x,λ}}(A) = λ^{1−k} σ_V(x + λA), and η is unchanged.

Route: 4.3 applied to δV, then the Lebesgue decomposition ‖δV‖ = f‖V‖ + σ_V of ‖δV‖ with respect
to ‖V‖ (`Measure.rnDeriv`, `Measure.singularPart`, a ‖V‖-null Borel set carrying the singular part);
put H_V = −f η and η_V = η on Z_V.

**Checks.**

- The half hyperplane Σ = {x_N = 0, x_1 > 0} of ℝ^N (N ≥ 2, k = N − 1) gives, by Fubini and the
  fundamental theorem of calculus in x_1, δ[Σ](X) = −∫_{x_1 = x_N = 0} X^1 dH^{N−2}: H = 0,
  σ = H^{N−2}⌞{x_1 = x_N = 0} and η = −e_1; the opposite sign convention would give +e_1.
- For L the x-axis of ℝ² and θ(y) = 1 + y_1², V = v(L, θ) has δV(X) = −∫ X^1 θ' dH¹, so
  H_V = (θ'/θ) e_1 is tangential and σ_V = 0: the generalised mean curvature of a varifold with
  non-constant multiplicity need not be normal.
- For the unit sphere S^k ⊆ ℝ^{k+1}, H_{[S^k]} = −k x and σ = 0; for the circle of radius R/λ
  obtained by dilating the circle of radius R, |H| = λ/R, as the dilation law predicts.

### 4.5 First variations for two metrics, and blow-ups in normal coordinates

Let Ω ⊆ ℝ^N be open (a coordinate chart) with smooth Riemannian metrics g and h, K ⊆ Ω compact, and
Λ_0 a bound for |g|, |g⁻¹|, |h|, |h⁻¹| and |Dg| on K (Euclidean norms of the coefficient matrices).
For a varifold V for g on Ω let V^h = id_#V be the same varifold for h (push-forward by the identity
of Ω from g to h, 3.1). There is C = C(N, Λ_0) such that for every V and every C¹ field X with
spt X ⊆ K,

`|δ_h V^h(X) − δ_g V(X)| ≤ C ( ‖h − g‖_{C⁰(K)} sup_K |DX| + ‖h − g‖_{C¹(K)} sup_K |X| ) ‖V‖(K)`.

The estimate is pointwise in (x, S): the orthogonal projections, the Jacobian J^{g→h} and the
Christoffel symbols of h and g differ by the indicated amounts (this roadmap; it is the step that
replaces chart transport in AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025 line 1788–1810, where
preservation of locally bounded first variation under a chart is asserted without proof).

Blow-up form. For x ∈ W, identify a normal ball B_r(x) with the ball B_r(0) of (T_xM, g_x) by
exp_x, let g̃ = exp_x^*g and g̃_λ(y) = g̃(λy) on B_{r/λ}(0). Then V_{x,λ} = (Ṽ_λ)^{g_x}, where Ṽ_λ is
the varifold for g̃_λ obtained from λ^{−k}V by the isometry y ↦ λ⁻¹ exp_x⁻¹(y) from (B_r(x), λ^{−2}g)
onto (B_{r/λ}(0), g̃_λ); for R > 0 and λ < r/R:

- ‖g̃_λ − g_x‖_{C¹(B_R(0))} ≤ C_R λ, with C_R depending on R and on g̃ near 0;
- ‖Ṽ_λ‖(B_R(0)) = λ^{−k}‖V‖(B_{λR}(x)) and ‖δ_{g̃_λ} Ṽ_λ‖(B_R(0)) = λ^{1−k}‖δV‖(B_{λR}(x)) (geodesic
  balls; exact);
- consequently |δ_{g_x} V_{x,λ}(Y)| ≤ λ^{1−k}‖δV‖(B_{λR}(x)) sup|Y| + C'_R λ (sup|Y| + sup|DY|)
  λ^{−k}‖V‖(B_{λR}(x)) for C¹ fields Y with spt Y ⊆ B_R(0).

**Checks.**

- For h = c²g with c > 0 constant, V^h = c^k V and div^h = div^g, so the left side is
  |c^k − 1| |δ_g V(X)|, bounded by k|c^k − 1| sup|DX| ‖V‖(K), of the form of the right side.
- The term in sup|DX| is necessary: for the Dirac varifold V = δ_{(0,P)} and X(y) = ψ(y) A y
  with ψ = 1 near 0, X(0) = 0 and DX(0) = A, the left side is |tr((J P^h − P^g) A)|, of order
  |h(0) − g(0)| |A|, while sup|X| can be made arbitrarily small relative to |A| by shrinking spt ψ.
- For the round unit sphere, x a point and V the varifold of a great circle through x, Ṽ_λ is the
  varifold of a diameter for g̃_λ, and δ_{g_x}V_{x,λ} = 0 because the blow-up is a line, consistent
  with the bound C'_R λ (sup|Y| + sup|DY|)·2R.

## Layer 5: smooth submanifolds and embedded ambient manifolds

### 5.1 The first variation of a C² submanifold

Let 1 ≤ k ≤ N and Σ ⊆ W be a C² embedded k-submanifold, closed in W, with Hᵏ(Σ ∩ K) < ∞ for every
compact K ⊆ W, and let H_Σ = (1/k) tr B be its averaged mean curvature (RiemannianGeometry R5a,
R5a.2). Then `δ[Σ](X) = −k ∫_Σ ⟨H_Σ, X⟩ dHᵏ` for every C¹ field X with compact support in W. Hence
[Σ] has locally bounded first variation, H_{[Σ]} = k H_Σ, σ_{[Σ]} = 0, and [Σ] is stationary in W if
and only if Σ is minimal (Simon1983 line 1950–1973, 9.3 and 9.5(2); 2979–2988, 16.6(1)). For smooth
Σ, δ[Σ](X) equals RiemannianGeometry R5a.2's first volume variation of the compactly supported
variation t ↦ φ_t ∘ ι of the inclusion ι of Σ.

Route: along Σ, div_{T_xΣ} X = div_Σ X^⊤ − ⟨X, tr B⟩ (differentiate ⟨X^⊥, τ_i⟩ = 0), and
∫_Σ div_Σ X^⊤ dHᵏ = 0 by the divergence theorem on the boundaryless Σ: X^⊤ is C¹ with compact
support in Σ because Σ is closed in W, and Hᵏ⌞Σ is the Riemannian volume of Σ (2.3). For smooth Σ
this is Tau Ceti's `TauCeti.Manifold.integral_divergence_eq_zero` for Σ with its induced metric;
for C² Σ it is the same identity in C² charts of Σ, by a partition of unity and Tau Ceti's flat
`MeasureTheory.integral_divergence_eq_zero` applied to the coordinate field times the volume density.

**Checks.**

- For the unit sphere S^k ⊆ ℝ^{k+1} (R5a: B = −g·x), H_{[S^k]} = −k x; with X = ψ x, ψ = 1 near the
  sphere, both sides give k Hᵏ(S^k).
- A great k-sphere of the round sphere S^N is totally geodesic, hence stationary in S^N.
- Closedness in W is necessary: the half hyperplane of 4.4 is minimal but not closed in ℝ^N, and
  σ ≠ 0.
- Hypersurfaces (k = N − 1) with unit normal ν: tr B = (tr S_ν) ν (R5a: ⟨S_ν X, Y⟩ = ⟨B(X, Y), ν⟩);
  for the outward normal of S^{N−1}, S_ν = −id and H_{[S^{N−1}]} = −(N − 1) x.
- For k = N and Σ = W, B = 0 and [W] is stationary, as in 4.2.

### 5.2 Varifolds on an embedded submanifold of Euclidean space

Let M ⊆ ℝ^L be a smooth embedded submanifold with the induced metric g and second fundamental form
B_M (RiemannianGeometry R5a), W ⊆ M open, and U ⊆ ℝ^L open with U ∩ M = W and W closed in U (such U
exists because M is locally closed). The inclusion ι : W → U is an isometric embedding, proper onto
its image. For a varifold V on W and every C¹ vector field X with compact support in U,

`δ(ι_#V)(X) = δV(X^⊤) − ∫ ⟨X(x), tr_S B_M(x)⟩ dV(x, S)`,

where X^⊤ = P_{TM}X restricted to W, a C¹ field with compact support in W, and tr_S B_M = Σ_i
B_M(τ_i, τ_i) for an orthonormal basis of S (Simon1983 line 2005–2016, 9.6; 2954–2971, 16.4; 7675–7682,
41.2(3)). Consequences:

- V has locally bounded first variation in W if and only if ι_#V has locally bounded first
  variation in U; then ‖δV‖ ≤ ‖δ(ι_#V)‖ on W and ‖δ(ι_#V)‖ ≤ ι_*(‖δV‖ + k|B_M| ‖V‖), with |B_M(x)| the
  largest |B_M(u, u)| over unit u.
- In that case H_{ι_#V}(x) = H_V(x) + ∫ tr_S B_M(x) dν^x(S) for ‖V‖-a.e. x (ν^x the fibre measures of
  3.3), σ_{ι_#V} = ι_*σ_V and η is unchanged. In particular V is stationary in W if and only if
  δ(ι_#V)(X) = 0 for every X tangent to M along W, and then ι_#V has σ = 0 and
  |H_{ι_#V}| ≤ k |B_M| ‖ι_#V‖-a.e.; for V = v(Γ, θ), H_{ι_#V}(x) = H_V(x) + tr_{T_xΓ} B_M(x).
- ι_# preserves rectifiability, integrality and multiplicities, and Θ^k(‖ι_#V‖, x) = Θ^k(‖V‖, x)
  for x ∈ W (Hᵏ for d_g and for the Euclidean distance agree on M, the two distances being locally
  bi-Lipschitz with constants tending to 1).

Route: div_S X = div_S X^⊤ + div_S X^⊥, ⟨D_τ X^⊤, τ⟩ = ⟨∇_τ X^⊤, τ⟩ for τ tangent to M, and
div_S X^⊥ = −⟨X, tr_S B_M⟩ by differentiating ⟨X^⊥, τ_i⟩ = 0.

**Checks.**

- M = S^N ⊆ ℝ^{N+1}, Σ a great k-sphere: B_{S^N}(u, v) = −⟨u, v⟩x, so tr_{TΣ} B = −k x and
  H_{ι_#[Σ]} = −k x, the mean curvature of a unit k-sphere of ℝ^{N+1} (5.1).
- M an affine subspace: B_M = 0 and δ(ι_#V)(X) = δV(X^⊤).
- V = 0 gives 0 = 0; for k = 0 both sides vanish.

### 6.1 The Euclidean monotonicity formula

Let W ⊆ E be open, V of locally bounded first variation in W, x ∈ W and
0 < ρ_0 ≤ dist(x, E ∖ W); write r = |y − x| and extend δV to bounded compactly supported Borel
fields by 4.4. For 0 < σ < ρ < ρ_0 the monotonicity identity holds:

`ρ^{−k}‖V‖(B_ρ(x)) − σ^{−k}‖V‖(B_σ(x)) = ∫_{G_k({σ ≤ r < ρ})} r^{−k−2}|P_{S^⊥}(y − x)|² dV(y, S) − ∫_σ^ρ t^{−k−1} δV(1_{B_t(x)}(y)(y − x)) dt`

(Simon1983 line 3016–3076, 17.2–17.5; 7513–7540, 40.1–40.3). Consequences and companions:

- If ‖δV‖(B_ρ(x)) ≤ Λ‖V‖(B_ρ(x)) for 0 < ρ < ρ_0, then for 0 < σ < ρ < ρ_0,
  `e^{Λσ}σ^{−k}‖V‖(B_σ(x)) ≤ e^{Λρ}ρ^{−k}‖V‖(B_ρ(x)) − ∫_{G_k({σ ≤ r < ρ})} r^{−k−2}|P_{S^⊥}(y − x)|² dV`,
  so ρ ↦ e^{Λρ}ρ^{−k}‖V‖(B_ρ(x)) is non-decreasing on (0, ρ_0) (Simon1983 line 7531–7533, 40.2).
- If |H_V| ≤ Λ ‖V‖-a.e. and σ_V = 0 on B_{ρ_0}(x), the hypothesis holds with the same Λ.
- If V is stationary in B_{ρ_0}(x), the identity has no first-variation term, Θ^k(‖V‖, x) exists, and
  `ω_k Θ^k(‖V‖, x) = ρ^{−k}‖V‖(B_ρ(x)) − ∫_{G_k(B_ρ(x))} r^{−k−2}|P_{S^⊥}(y − x)|² dV` (Simon1983 line

- Weighted identity: for nonnegative C¹ h on W and φ a C¹ cut-off profile with φ' ≤ 0, φ = 1 on
  (−∞, 1/2] and φ = 0 on [1, ∞), put I(ρ) = ∫ φ(r/ρ) h d‖V‖ and X_ρ(y) = φ(r/ρ) h(y)(y − x); then
  `d/dρ (ρ^{−k} I(ρ)) = ρ^{−k} d/dρ ∫ φ(r/ρ) h |P_{S^⊥}(y − x)|² r^{−2} dV + ρ^{−k−1} ( ∫ φ(r/ρ) (y − x)·P_S ∇h dV − δV(X_ρ) )`
  (Simon1983 line 7541–7547, 40.4, and 3205–3221, 18.1).

**Checks.**

- For a k-plane through x the ratio ρ^{−k}‖V‖(B_ρ(x)) is ω_k times its multiplicity, and the
  integrand |P_{S^⊥}(y − x)|² vanishes; for a cone with vertex x the ratio is constant and
  P_{S^⊥}(y − x) = 0 on its support.
- For the line L = {y_2 = a} of ℝ² (a > 0), x = 0 and σ < a < ρ: the left side is
  ρ⁻¹·2√(ρ² − a²) and the right side is ∫ a²(t² + a²)^{−3/2} dt over |t| < √(ρ² − a²), which equals
  2√(ρ² − a²)/ρ.
- For the unit circle C of ℝ², x = 0 and σ < 1 < ρ: the left side is 2π/ρ; the first term of the
  right side is 2π and, since H = −y on C, δV(1_{B_t}(y) y) = 2π for t > 1 and 0 for t ≤ 1, so the
  second term is 2π(1 − 1/ρ); the identity holds with the minus sign and fails with a plus sign.

### 6.2 The Riemannian monotonicity formula

Let V have locally bounded first variation in W ⊆ M, x ∈ W, κ ≥ 0, and 0 < ρ_0 such that B_{ρ_0}(x)
is a normal ball of x contained in W, the sectional curvature is at most κ on B_{ρ_0}(x), and
√κ ρ_0 ≤ π/2. Then for 0 < σ < ρ < ρ_0,

`σ^{−k}‖V‖(B̄_σ(x)) ≤ ρ^{−k}‖V‖(B̄_ρ(x)) + ∫_σ^ρ t^{−k} ( ‖δV‖(B̄_t(x)) + k√κ ‖V‖(B̄_t(x)) ) dt`,

and if ‖δV‖(B̄_t(x)) ≤ Λ‖V‖(B̄_t(x)) for 0 < t < ρ_0, then ρ ↦ e^{(Λ + k√κ)ρ}ρ^{−k}‖V‖(B̄_ρ(x)) is
non-decreasing on (0, ρ_0) (Scharrer2022 line 1120–1127 and 1184–1203, Lemma 3.3 and Remark 3.4;
AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025 line 542, Lemma 2.22).

Route: with r = d_g(x, ·), the field r∇r = ½∇r² is smooth on the normal ball (HopfRinow Layer 2),
and RiemannianGeometry R4 item 1 gives ∇(r∇r) ≥ √κ r cot(√κ r) g, hence
div_S(r∇r) ≥ k √κ r cot(√κ r) for every k-plane S (Scharrer2022 line 823–854, Lemma 2.7); test δV with
φ(r/t) r∇r and integrate in t; (1 − x cot x)/x ≤ 2/π on (0, π/2]; the exponential form follows by
Grönwall's inequality.

**Checks.**

- For κ = 0 and M = E, the statement is 6.1's inequality without the |P_{S^⊥}|² term.
- On the unit sphere S² (κ = 1) with V a great circle through x, ‖V‖(B̄_ρ(x)) = 2ρ for ρ < π, so the
  ratio is constant and e^{(0 + 1)ρ}·2 is non-decreasing, consistent; the bound
  (1 − x cot x)/x ≤ 2/π is attained at x = π/2.
- The hypothesis √κ ρ_0 ≤ π/2 cannot be dropped from the route: at √κ r = π the comparison factor
  √κ r cot(√κ r) is −∞.

- Existence: Θ^k(‖V‖, x) exists and is finite whenever ‖δV‖(B_ρ(x)) ≤ Λ‖V‖(B_ρ(x)) for all small ρ;
  this holds for ‖V‖-a.e. x ∈ W, so Θ^k(‖V‖, ·) exists ‖V‖-a.e. (and is 0 off spt‖V‖); it holds at
  every x ∈ W when |H_V| is locally bounded and σ_V = 0, in particular when V is stationary
  (Simon1983 line 7550–7555, 40.5; AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025 line 1680, Theorem 2.30).
- Θ^k(‖V‖, ·) is ‖V‖-measurable (Simon1983 line 7556–7565).
- Upper semicontinuity in x: if ‖δV‖ ≤ Λ‖V‖ on an open set U, then Θ^k(‖V‖, x) ≥ lim sup_{y→x}
  Θ^k(‖V‖, y) for x ∈ U (Simon1983 line 3119–3144, 17.8; AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025 line
  1448–1546, Corollary 2.27 and Remark 2.28).
- Upper semicontinuity under convergence: if V_j → V, ‖δV_j‖ ≤ Λ‖V_j‖ on U for all j, and x_j → x ∈ U,
  then ‖δV‖ ≤ Λ‖V‖ on U and Θ^k(‖V‖, x) ≥ lim sup_j Θ^k(‖V_j‖, x_j) (this roadmap, by the argument of
  Simon1983 17.8 with 1.4's upper semicontinuity on compact sets).
- Lower bound: if V is rectifiable, Θ^k(‖V‖, ·) ≥ 1 ‖V‖-a.e. (in particular if V is integral), and
  ‖δV‖ ≤ Λ‖V‖ on U, then Θ^k(‖V‖, x) ≥ 1 for every x ∈ spt‖V‖ ∩ U, and ‖V‖(B̄_ρ(x)) ≥
  e^{−(Λ + k√κ)ρ} ω_k ρ^k for the ρ admitted in 6.2 (Simon1983 line 3147–3152, 17.9(1)).

Route for a.e. existence on M: Besicovitch's theorem in charts (Mathlib's finite-dimensional
`HasBesicovitchCovering`) bounds ‖δV‖ by Λ_x‖V‖ on small chart-Euclidean balls about ‖V‖-a.e. x;
chart balls and geodesic balls are nested up to a factor c; inserting
‖δV‖(B̄_t(x)) ≤ Λ_x c^{2k} t^k f(c²t), f(t) = t^{−k}‖V‖(B̄_t(x)), into 6.2 bounds sup_{(0, ρ]} f for small
ρ and gives lim sup_{σ↓0} f(σ) ≤ lim inf_{ρ↓0} f(ρ).

**Checks.**

- For the unit circle Θ^1 = 1 on the circle and 0 elsewhere; for v(L, 3), Θ = 3 on L.
- For two lines crossing at 0, Θ(0) = 2 while Θ = 1 at nearby points of the support: Θ is upper and
  not lower semicontinuous.
- For three half-lines from 0 at angles 2π/3 (a stationary 1-varifold), ‖V‖(B_ρ(0)) = 3ρ and
  Θ(0) = 3/2.
- σ_V = 0 cannot be dropped from upper semicontinuity: v(L, θ) on the x-axis with θ = 1 on
  (−∞, 0) and θ = 2 on (0, ∞) has an atom of ‖δV‖ at 0 (σ_V = δ_0, η = −e_1), Θ(0) = 3/2 and
  Θ(y) = 2 for y > 0.
- v(L, 1/2) satisfies everything except the hypothesis Θ ≥ 1 of the lower bound, and has
  Θ = 1/2 on L.

### 6.4 The constancy theorem

Let V be stationary in W and Σ ⊆ W a connected C² embedded k-submanifold with spt‖V‖ ⊆ Σ. Then
either V = 0, or Σ is closed in W, Hᵏ(Σ ∩ K) < ∞ for every compact K ⊆ W (so that [Σ] is defined,
2.3), and V = θ_0 [Σ] for a constant θ_0 > 0 (Simon1983 line 7664–7732, 41.1–41.2(1)).

Route: for a C² function f vanishing on Σ, div_S(f∇f) = |P_S ∇f|² on spt V, so stationarity forces
P_S ∇f = 0 on spt V; with local defining functions whose gradients span the normal spaces, S = T_xΣ
on spt V. The density exists everywhere (6.3) and equals 1 for Hᵏ⌞Σ, so V = v(Σ, θ) with
θ = Θ^k(‖V‖, ·). Stationarity against fields tangent to Σ says that, in a C² chart of Σ, the
distributional derivatives of θ times the volume density vanish against all test functions, and
GeometricCurrents G1's constancy criterion makes θ locally constant, hence equal to a constant θ_0 on
the connected Σ. If θ_0 = 0, V = 0. If θ_0 > 0, Hᵏ⌞Σ = θ_0⁻¹‖V‖ is a Radon measure, so Σ has
locally finite area, and the closure of Σ in W is spt‖V‖ (2.3), which lies in Σ: Σ is closed in W.

**Checks.**

- v(L, 3) on a line L: θ_0 = 3.
- Two parallel lines L_1, L_2 with V = v(L_1, 1) + v(L_2, 2) is stationary with non-constant
  multiplicity on the disconnected L_1 ∪ L_2: connectedness is necessary.
- For k = N and Σ = W connected, a stationary N-varifold is a constant multiple of the Riemannian
  volume.
- [half-line] has support in a line Σ but is not a constant multiple of [Σ]; consistently it is not
  stationary (σ = δ_0 at its endpoint).
- The graph Σ of t ↦ sin(1/t) over (0, 1) is a connected C² embedded curve in ℝ² of infinite length
  inside B̄_2(0) (its length is at least ∫_0^1 |cos(1/t)| t⁻² dt = ∫_1^∞ |cos u| du = ∞), and it is
  not closed (its closure contains {0} × [−1, 1]). V = 0 is stationary with support in Σ and takes
  the first alternative, and the theorem says it is the only such V; a conclusion "V = θ_0 [Σ] in
  every case" would use [Σ], which 2.3 does not define for this Σ.

(constancy criterion).

### 6.5 The convex hull property

Let V be a varifold on E with spt‖V‖ compact, stationary in E ∖ K for a compact K ⊆ E. Then
spt‖V‖ is contained in the convex hull of K; for K = ∅, V = 0 (Simon1983 line 3373–3400, 19.1–19.2).

Route: for a closed ball B̄_R(ξ) ⊇ K and γ ≥ 0 non-decreasing, vanishing on [0, R + ε], test δV with
ψ(y)γ(|y − ξ|)(y − ξ), ψ = 1 near spt‖V‖; then div_S ≥ kγ and ∫ γ d‖V‖ = 0.

**Checks.**

- The varifold of the segment [−1, 1] × {0} is stationary off its endpoints and lies in their
  convex hull.
- For K the closed unit disc of ℝ², the unit circle is stationary in E ∖ K (its support misses
  E ∖ K) and lies in K; for K = {0} it is not stationary in E ∖ K (H = −y ≠ 0 on the circle), and the
  conclusion spt ⊆ {0} indeed fails.
- δ_{(0,P)} is stationary in E ∖ {0} and its support {0} is the hull of K = {0}.

(Simon1983 line 3373–3400.) *Needs:* Layer 4.1–4.4.

junction and two crossing lines as density examples; the step multiplicity showing why σ_V = 0 is
needed; the great circle on S².

## Layer 7: varifold tangents, rectifiability and compactness

**Standing setting for varying metrics.** g_i and g are smooth Riemannian metrics on W with
g_i → g in C² on compact subsets (in charts); V_i is a varifold for g_i, regarded on G_k^g(W)
through 1.2's canonical homeomorphism (which leaves the weights unchanged), and V_i → V there. The
case g_i = g is the fixed-metric case, and g_i = g = e on W ⊆ E is Simon's setting.

### 7.1 Semicontinuity of lower density bounds

In the standing setting, suppose each V_i has locally bounded g_i-first variation,
lim inf_i ‖δ_{g_i} V_i‖(U) < ∞ for every open U with compact closure in W, and
Θ^k_{g_i}(‖V_i‖, y) ≥ 1 for ‖V_i‖-a.e. y ∈ W ∖ B_i, where ‖V_i‖(B_i ∩ K) → 0 for every compact K ⊆ W.
Then V has locally bounded g-first variation, ‖δ_g V‖(U) ≤ lim inf_i ‖δ_{g_i} V_i‖(U) for such U, and
Θ^k_g(‖V‖, y) ≥ 1 for ‖V‖-a.e. y ∈ W (Simon1983 line 7566–7579, 40.6, for g_i = g = e).

Route: the first two conclusions follow from δ_{g_i}V_i(X) → δ_g V(X) (the integrands converge
uniformly on compact sets) and |X|_{g_i} → |X|_g. For the density, run Simon's covering argument
(Simon1983 line 7592–7660) in charts: the good sets A_{ij} are defined by the ratio bound
‖δ_{g_i}V_i‖ ≤ j‖V_i‖ on chart-Euclidean balls, so that Besicovitch's theorem (Mathlib's
finite-dimensional `HasBesicovitchCovering`) bounds the bad sets; at points of A_{ij} of density at
least 1, the inequality of 6.2 for (V_i, g_i), whose constants are uniform in i because the
sectional curvatures and normal radii of g_i are uniformly controlled on compact sets, and the
nesting of chart balls and g_i-geodesic balls as in 6.3 give ‖V_i‖(B̄^{g_i}_ρ(y)) ≥ (ω_k − Cρ)ρ^k with C
uniform; geodesic balls of g_i about y_i → x lie in B̄^g_{ρ+ε}(x) for large i, and 1.4 passes the
bound to V.

**Checks.**

- A sequence of integral varifolds V_i whose weights converge to ½H¹⌞L is excluded by the first
  variation bound, not by the density bound: the varifolds of i disjoint segments of length 1/(2i)
  equally spaced in [0, 1] × {0} have Θ = 1 a.e. and ‖δV_i‖ equal to twice the number of segments,
  which tends to ∞; the limit ½ v([0, 1] × {0}, 1) has density ½.
- The constant sequence V_i = ½ v(L, 1) is stationary, with density ½ < 1, and its limit has density
  ½: the density hypothesis is necessary.
- For g_i = (1 + 1/i)² e on ℝ² and V_i the g_i-varifold of a line with multiplicity 1, Θ_{g_i} = 1 and
  the limit, the Euclidean varifold of the line, has Θ = 1.

`HasBesicovitchCovering`.

### 7.2 Varifold tangents

Let V be a varifold on W ⊆ M with locally bounded first variation on a neighbourhood of x ∈ W, such that
Θ^k(‖V‖, x) exists and is finite and ρ^{1−k}‖δV‖(B_ρ(x)) → 0 as ρ ↓ 0. Then
every sequence λ_j ↓ 0 has a subsequence along which V_{x,λ_j} converges, as varifolds on T_xM, to a
varifold C that is stationary in (T_xM, g_x), whose weight is dilation invariant,
‖C‖(λA) = λ^k‖C‖(A) for λ > 0, and with ‖C‖(B_ρ(0)) = Θ^k(‖V‖, x) ω_k ρ^k for all ρ > 0, so that
Θ^k(‖C‖, 0) = Θ^k(‖V‖, x). The set VarTan(V, x) of such limits is nonempty and compact; in E it
consists of the limits of (η_{x,λ_j})_#V (Simon1983 line 7733–7774, 42.1–42.3; 3414–3430, 19.3).

Route: 3.2 and 6.3 bound ‖V_{x,λ}‖(B_R(0)) uniformly; 1.4 gives subsequential limits; 4.5's blow-up form
and the hypothesis on ‖δV‖ give δ_{g_x}C = 0; the mass of C on balls about 0 is the limit of the
density ratios (3.2); the stationary identity 6.1 for C at 0 forces P_{S^⊥}(y) = 0 C-a.e.; the
weighted identity 6.1 with h(y) = f(|y|)-type weights gives dilation invariance of the weight, as in
Simon1983 19.3.

**Checks.**

- V = v(P_1, 1) + v(P_2, 1) for two k-planes through 0 in ℝ^N: VarTan(V, 0) = {V} and Θ(0) = 2.
- The triple junction of three half-lines at angles 2π/3: VarTan(V, 0) = {V}, Θ(0) = 3/2.
- For the unit circle and x on it, VarTan = {v(T_x, 1)}; for Lebesgue measure on ℝ² with a constant
  line (k = 1, stationary, Θ = 0), VarTan(V, x) = {0}.
- On the round S², V a great circle through x: V_{x,λ} is the varifold of a diameter of the disc of
  radius r/λ, and VarTan(V, x) = {v(T_xC, 1)}.

### 7.3 Allard's rectifiability theorem

Let V have locally bounded first variation in W ⊆ M with Θ^k(‖V‖, x) > 0 for ‖V‖-a.e. x ∈ W. Then V is
rectifiable: V = v(Γ, θ) with Γ countably k-rectifiable, θ = Θ^k(‖V‖, ·) locally Hᵏ-integrable
(Simon1983 line 7775–7790, 42.4–42.5; AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025 line 1796–1798,
Theorem 2.32).

Route (Simon1983 line 7806–7881): at ‖V‖-a.e. x, (i) Θ(x) ∈ (0, ∞) exists (6.3), (ii) the fibre
measure ν^x is the limit of ball averages (3.3), (iii) Θ is ‖V‖-approximately continuous at x (the
Vitali family of 3.3), and (iv) ‖δV‖(B_ρ(x)) ≤ Λ(x)‖V‖(B_ρ(x)) for small ρ. At such x each
C ∈ VarTan(V, x) (7.2) satisfies Θ(‖C‖, y) ≥ Θ(x) for ‖C‖-a.e. y, by 7.1 applied to the rescaled
varifolds Ṽ_{λ_j} of 4.5 for the metrics g̃_{λ_j} → g_x (divided by (1 − ε)Θ(x)), and so at every
y ∈ spt‖C‖ (6.3); with ‖C‖(B_ρ(y)) ≤ Θ(x)ω_kρ^k from the weight's form, the identity 6.1 for C at y
gives P_{S^⊥}(z − y) = 0, so spt‖C‖ lies in a k-plane T, 6.4 gives C = Θ(x) v(T, 1), and (ii) makes T
unique; 3.3's first rectifiability theorem concludes. The chart transport asserted in
AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025's proof is not used.

**Checks.**

- Lebesgue measure on ℝ² with a constant line is stationary with Θ^1 = 0 everywhere and is not
  rectifiable: positive density is necessary.
- The triple junction and v(L, 1/2) are rectifiable, with θ = Θ equal to 1 off the junction and to
  1/2 respectively.
- The vertical lift of H¹⌞(x-axis) has positive density and is not rectifiable; consistently it does
  not have locally bounded first variation (4.2).

(Simon1983 line 7775–7881; Allard1972 Section 5.) *Needs:* Layer 3.3, Layer 4.5, Layer 6.1, Layer 6.3–6.4, Layer 7.1–7.2.

### 7.4 Compactness of rectifiable varifolds

In the standing setting let the V_i be rectifiable with locally bounded g_i-first variation,
sup_i (‖V_i‖(U) + ‖δ_{g_i}V_i‖(U)) < ∞ for every open U with compact closure in W, and
Θ^k_{g_i}(‖V_i‖, ·) ≥ 1 ‖V_i‖-a.e. outside sets B_i with ‖V_i‖(B_i ∩ K) → 0 for compact K. Then a
subsequence converges to a rectifiable varifold V with locally bounded g-first variation,
Θ^k_g(‖V‖, ·) ≥ 1 ‖V‖-a.e., and ‖δ_g V‖(U) ≤ lim inf ‖δ_{g_i}V_i‖(U); stationarity passes to the limit
(Simon1983 line 7882–7898, 42.7).

Route: 1.4 for a convergent subsequence, 7.1 for the density bound and the first variation, 7.3 for
rectifiability.

**Checks.**

- Zigzag graphs of slopes ±1 and amplitude 1/i over [0, 1] are integral with Θ = 1, but ‖δV_i‖ is
  √2 times the number of corners, which tends to ∞; their limit has weight √2 H¹⌞([0, 1] × {0}) and
  planes at ±45°, so it is not rectifiable: the first variation bound is necessary.
- Circles of radius 1/i about 0: masses 2π/i → 0, ‖δV_i‖ = 2π, the limit is 0, which is rectifiable.
- Varifolds of the lines y_2 = 1/i converge to the varifold of the x-axis, with all first variations 0.

(Simon1983 line 7882–7898; Allard1972 Section 6.) *Needs:* Layer 1.4, Layer 7.1, Layer 7.3.

### 7.5 Allard's multiplicity lemma

Let p and q be the orthogonal projections of ℝ^N onto ℝ^k × {0} and {0} × ℝ^{N−k}. For δ ∈ (0, 1) and
Λ ≥ 1 there is ε = ε(δ, Λ, k, N) ∈ (0, δ²) such that, for every integral varifold W on the ball B_3(0)
of ℝ^N for a metric h with ‖h − e‖_{C²(B_3(0))} ≤ ε satisfying the mass, first variation and tilt
hypotheses of Simon1983 42.9 (mass at most Λ, ‖δ_h W‖ at most ε and ∫ ‖P_S − p‖ dW at most ε on
B_3(0)), there is a Borel set A ⊆ ℝ^k × {0} of Lebesgue measure at most δ such that for
x ∈ (B_1(0) ∩ ℝ^k × {0}) ∖ A the sum of Θ^k(‖W‖, y) over the points y ∈ p⁻¹(x) ∩ spt‖W‖ with |q(y)| < ε
is at most (1 + δ)(ω_k 2^k)⁻¹‖W‖(B_2(x)) + δ (Simon1983 line 7986–8151, 42.9–42.10, for h = e).

Route: Simon's proof (induction on the number of points of a fibre) uses the first variation only
through the identity and the weighted identity of 6.1, tested with fields X satisfying
|DX| ≤ C(1 + ρ/T) on the balls B_ρ used, T the slab width; by 4.5 the metric h adds errors
Cε(1 + ρ/T)‖W‖(B_ρ), of the same form as the terms Cερ/T already present, and 6.2 replaces the
Euclidean mass lower bounds.

**Checks.**

- W = m v(ℝ^k × {0}, 1)⌞B_3(0) with integer m ≥ 1: tilt 0, δW = 0 in B_3(0), each fibre has the single
  point x with density m, and the bound m ≤ (1 + δ)m + δ holds with A = ∅.
- Two parallel planes ℝ^k × {±ε/2} with multiplicity 1: fibre sum 2 and mass ratio about 2.
- A plane tilted by angle α has tilt excess of order α‖W‖(B_3), so for α large the hypotheses fail;
  the tilted plane through 0 still satisfies the conclusion, showing that the tilt hypothesis is used
  for the slab, not for single planes.

(Simon1983 line 7986–8151.) *Needs:* Layer 4.5, Layer 6.1–6.3.

### 7.6 Integral compactness

If, in 7.4, the V_i are integral, then the limit V is integral (Simon1983 line 7899–7912, 42.8;
Allard1972, Section 6).

Route (Simon1983 line 7916–7985): Besicovitch in charts gives, for ‖V‖-a.e. x, lim inf_i
‖δ_{g_i}V_i‖(B_ρ(x)) ≤ c(x)ρ^k for small ρ; at ‖V‖-a.e. x the varifold V = v(Γ, θ) has tangent space
T_x with multiplicity θ(x) (7.4, 3.3); in g-normal coordinates at x a diagonal choice λ_i ↓ 0 gives
integral varifolds W_i for metrics h_i → g_x in C² with W_i → θ(x) v(T_x, 1), first variation → 0 and
tilt → 0 on B_3(0); 7.5 together with the convergence of the fibre multiplicities in L¹
(the area formula, 3.1) shows that min(ψ_i, N) converges in L¹ to θ(x) for integers N > θ(x), so θ(x)
is an integer.

**Checks.**

- Varifolds v(L, 1) + v(L_i, 1) with lines L_i → L converge to v(L, 2): multiplicities add.
- The constant sequence ½ v(L, 1) is rectifiable, not integral, and its limit is not integral: the
  theorem needs integral V_i.
- The segment varifolds of 7.1 converge to ½ v([0, 1] × {0}, 1), not integral; their first variations
  are unbounded, so 7.4's hypotheses fail.

(Simon1983 line 7899–7985; Allard1972 Section 6.) *Needs:* Layer 3.1, Layer 3.3, Layer 4.5,
Layer 7.4–7.5; Mathlib `HasBesicovitchCovering`.

## Layer 8: tangent cones

### 8.1 Rectifiable tangent cones

Let V and x be as in 7.2, and suppose moreover that
ρ^{−k}‖V‖({y ∈ B_ρ(x) : Θ^k(‖V‖, y) < 1}) → 0 as ρ ↓ 0. Then every C ∈ VarTan(V, x) is rectifiable and
satisfies (η_{0,λ})_#C = C for every λ > 0: C = v(Γ_C, θ_C) with λΓ_C = Γ_C and θ_C(λy) = θ_C(y), and
y ∈ T_yΓ_C wherever the tangent space exists (Simon1983 line 7793–7805, 42.6).

Route: 7.1 applied to the rescaled varifolds of 4.5 gives Θ(‖C‖, ·) ≥ 1 ‖C‖-a.e.; 7.3 makes C
rectifiable with θ_C = Θ(‖C‖, ·), which is dilation invariant by 7.2; P_{S^⊥}(y) = 0 C-a.e. gives
y ∈ T_yΓ_C.

**Checks.**

- The union of two k-planes through 0 and the triple junction are cones equal to their own tangent
  cones.
- For V = ½ v(L, 1) the extra hypothesis fails (Θ = ½ < 1), yet VarTan(V, 0) = {½ v(L, 1)} is still a
  rectifiable cone: the hypothesis is sufficient, not necessary.
- For V = v(L, θ) with the step multiplicity of 6.3, ρ^{1−k}‖δV‖(B_ρ(0)) = 1 does not tend to 0 (k = 1),
  so 7.2's hypothesis fails at 0.

(Simon1983 line 7793–7805.) *Needs:* Layer 4.5, Layer 7.1–7.3.

### 8.2 Integral tangent cones

If V is integral with locally bounded first variation and x satisfies 7.2's hypotheses, then every
C ∈ VarTan(V, x) is an integral varifold, stationary in (T_xM, g_x), with (η_{0,λ})_#C = C, and
Θ^k(‖V‖, x) = Θ^k(‖C‖, 0) ≥ 1 when x ∈ spt‖V‖ and ‖δV‖ ≤ Λ‖V‖ near x. If V is integral and stationary
in W, the hypotheses hold at every x ∈ W, and VarTan(V, x) is a nonempty compact set of stationary
integral cones (Simon1983 line 7793–7805 and 7899–7912; EdelenSpolaor2023 line 109–112 uses this
notion of tangent cone).

Route: integrality gives Θ ≥ 1 ‖V‖-a.e., so 8.1 applies; 7.6 for the blow-up sequence of 4.5 with
metrics converging to g_x gives integrality of C; 6.3 gives the density bound.

**Checks.**

- For the varifold of a smooth embedded minimal surface, the tangent cone at each point is its
  tangent plane with multiplicity 1.
- For v(P_1, 1) + v(P_2, 1), the cone at 0 is integral with density 2.
- For the cone C_{p,q} = {q|x|² = p|y|²} ⊆ ℝ^{p+1} × ℝ^{q+1} with multiplicity 1 (p, q ≥ 1), the cone is
  its own tangent cone at 0 and its density there equals its mass ratio on the unit ball.

For r ∈ {1, 2, …} ∪ {∞}, a point x ∈ spt‖V‖ is C^r-regular when some open U ∋ x has spt‖V‖ ∩ U a C^r
embedded k-submanifold of U; reg^r V is the set of such points and sing^r V = spt‖V‖ ∖ reg^r V

73–83 for r = ∞ and hypersurfaces).

- reg^r V is open in spt‖V‖ and sing^r V is closed in W; reg^∞ V ⊆ reg^{r'} V ⊆ reg^r V for r ≤ r'.
- For a C^r diffeomorphism f of W onto W', spt‖f_#V‖ = f(spt‖V‖), f(reg^r V) = reg^r(f_#V) and
  f(sing^r V) = sing^r(f_#V).
- For open W' ⊆ W, reg^r of the restriction of V to W' is reg^r V ∩ W'.
- If V is stationary and x ∈ reg^2 V, then on a neighbourhood U of x with spt‖V‖ ∩ U connected,
  V⌞U = θ_0 [spt‖V‖ ∩ U] for a constant θ_0 > 0 (6.4): the multiplicity is locally constant on reg^2 V.

**Checks.**

- For two crossing lines and for the triple junction, sing^r V = {0} for every r.
- For V = v(graph of t ↦ |t|^{3/2}, 1) in ℝ², 0 ∈ reg^1 V ∖ reg^2 V: the classes differ.
- For V = 0 both sets are empty; for ½ v(L, 1), reg^r V = L: regularity of the support ignores the
  multiplicity.
- For the cone C_{p,q} with multiplicity 1, sing^r = {0} for every r.

### 9.2 Locality and isometry invariance

Every notion of Layers 1–8 commutes with restriction to an open W' ⊆ W: weight, mass, support,
convergence, rectifiability and integrality, tangent spaces and fibre measures, δV, ‖δV‖, H_V, σ_V,
η_V, stationarity and locally bounded first variation, densities, VarTan(V, x) for x ∈ W', and
reg^r, sing^r. Every notion commutes with push-forward by an isometry f between open subsets of
Riemannian manifolds, with H, η transported by df; it is independent of charts because no chart
enters the definitions. Euclidean dilations preserve stationarity, rectifiability, integrality,
reg^r and sing^r, satisfy Θ^k(‖V_{x,λ}‖, η_{x,λ}(y)) = Θ^k(‖V‖, y) and VarTan(V_{x,λ}, η_{x,λ}(y)) =
VarTan(V, y), and scale H_V, ‖δV‖ and σ_V as in 4.4 (this roadmap; Simon1983 line 7443–7454).

**Checks.**

- Rotating two crossing lines rotates the tangent cone and keeps Θ(0) = 2.
- Restricting the unit circle to an open set meeting it in an arc gives the arc, with the same H
  and no boundary measure inside the open set.
- The dilation by λ⁻¹ of the circle of radius R has H of length λ/R and the same density 1.

*Needs:* Layers 1–8.

### 9.3 Comparison with GeometricCurrents G6

Let T be a locally integral k-current on W (GeometricCurrents G2), represented by a countably
k-rectifiable carrier Γ_T, an orienting simple k-vector and an integer multiplicity θ_T, and let 𝐯_T
be GeometricCurrents G6's auxiliary varifold of T. Through 1.2's homeomorphism, 𝐯_T = v(Γ_T, |θ_T|),
an integral varifold whose weight is the mass measure ‖T‖; G6's weak first variation of T under
compactly supported ambient flows equals δ v(Γ_T, |θ_T|); G6's density, monotonicity with
Riemannian error bounds and tangent cones of T are 6.1–6.3, 7.2 and 8.2 for v(Γ_T, |θ_T|); and for a
locally minimizing T (GeometricCurrents G5), G6's stationarity is the stationarity of v(Γ_T, |θ_T|)
(this roadmap; Simon1983 line 7253–7293).

**Checks.**

- The current of an oriented k-plane with multiplicity 2 has varifold v(P, 2); reversing the
  orientation gives the same varifold.
- The current [[P]] + (−[[P]]) is 0 and its varifold is 0, while v(P, 1) + v(P, 1) = v(P, 2): the
  varifold of a sum of currents is not the sum of their varifolds.
- The current of a smooth closed oriented curve with multiplicity 1 has varifold [curve], with
  H = curvature vector.

*Needs:* Layer 1.2, Layer 2.2, Layer 4.1–4.4, Layer 6.1–6.3, Layer 7.2, Layer 8.2; GeometricCurrents
G1, G2, G5, G6.

### 9.4 Statement-level acceptance tests

The following theorems of the literature are statable with the definitions of this roadmap; they are
neither targets nor headline theorems of this roadmap, and test that its carrier and notions are the
ones the literature uses.

- Simon's theorem (Simon2023 line 84–96, Theorem 1.1, and line 432–441, Theorem 3.7). Let n ≥ 3,
  m ≥ 2, n + m ≥ 8, ℓ ≥ 1 and K ⊆ ℝ^ℓ closed. For every sufficiently small τ ∈ (0, 1) there are a
  smooth f(x, y) on ℝ^n × ℝ^ℓ with sup|f − 1| < τ and sup|D^j f| < C(ℓ, m, n, j)τ for j ≥ 1, and a
  smooth embedded hypersurface Σ ⊆ ℝ^{n+m+ℓ} with locally finite area, such that for the metric
  g = Σ dx_i² + f(x, y) Σ dξ_j² + Σ dy_k² the varifold [Σ] for g is stationary in (ℝ^{n+m+ℓ}, g) and
  sing^∞[Σ] = {0} × {0} × K. Simon's theorem also asserts strict stability, a second-variation
  statement of RiemannianGeometry R5b's kind, which is not restated here.
- Edelen–Spolaor's theorem in dimensions n ≥ 8 (EdelenSpolaor2023 line 104–135, Definition 1.1.1,
  Remark 1.2 and Theorem 1.4). Let V be a stationary integral n-varifold in the open unit ball B_1 of
  ℝ^{n+1} with Θ^n(‖V‖, ·) = 1 ‖V‖-a.e., sing^∞ V ⊆ {0}, and some element of VarTan(V, 0) equal to
  R_# v(C_{p,q}, 1) for integers p, q ≥ 1 with p + q = n − 1 and a linear isometry R (the cone
  C_{p,q} = {q|x|² = p|y|²} ⊆ ℝ^{p+1} × ℝ^{q+1} is not a submanifold at 0, and v(C_{p,q}, 1) =
  [C_{p,q} ∖ {0}] for the smooth embedded hypersurface C_{p,q} ∖ {0} of locally finite area). If V_i
  are stationary integral n-varifolds in B_1 with V_i → V, then for all large i, sing^∞(V_i) ∩ B_{1/2}
  is either empty or a single point y_i at which some element of VarTan(V_i, y_i) equals
  R'_# v(C_{p,q}, 1) for a linear isometry R'. (For n ≥ 8 every C_{p,q} is area minimizing, so the
  minimizing hypothesis of Theorem 1.4 holds.)

**Checks.**

- Each notion used is defined above: [Σ] for a metric (2.3), stationarity for a metric (4.2),
  sing^∞ (9.1), integral varifolds and multiplicity one (2.2, 6.3), varifold convergence (1.4) and
  tangent cones (7.2, 8.2).
- In Simon's theorem with K = ∅, sing^∞[Σ] = ∅ and Σ is closed.
- V = v(C_{p,q}, 1) itself, with V_i = V, satisfies the conclusion of the second statement with
  y_i = 0.

*Needs:* Layer 1.4, Layer 2.2–2.3, Layer 3.1, Layer 4.2, Layer 6.3, Layer 7.2, Layer 8.2,
Layer 9.1.

### Examples

Crossing lines, the |t|^{3/2} graph and the quadratic cones for regular and singular sets; the
current of a plane with multiplicity and the cancelling sum of two currents.

### Dependencies

Layers 1–8; GeometricCurrents G1, G2, G5, G6.

## Downstream consumers

- The comparison with GeometricCurrents G6 (9.3) runs in the supplier direction: GeometricCurrents
  is earlier and does not consume this roadmap.
- Varifolds, Part II: Allard's regularity theorem, Euclidean and intrinsically Riemannian
  (Allard1972 Section 8; AgnolettoCorreaHoyosDaSilvaNardulli2025 Section 3), starts from the carrier,
  the first variation, the monotonicity formula, the density theorems and varifold tangents of
  Layers 1–8.
- Future roadmaps on Almgren–Pitts min-max and the existence of minimal hypersurfaces, on Brakke
  flows, on stable codimension-one regularity, and on interface regularity for isoperimetric
  clusters use the same carrier; the two statements of 9.4 are formulated in it.
