# Arithmetic locally symmetric spaces, part II: target signatures

The roadmap is `README.md`; this file is not the roadmap. It states the roadmap's headline
theorems that are statable against the pinned Mathlib and Tau Ceti, each with `sorry`, together
with the two simple definitions they need: the standard representation of a subgroup of
`SL₂(𝓞_F)` through a complex embedding of `F`, and the algebraic coefficient system
`⊗_σ Sym^{t_σ}(ℂ²)` indexed by the complex embeddings `σ` of `F`.

Stated here (README §4.2 and §5.8):

* the ordinary-cohomology form of Fu's sharp bound: for a number field with a complex place
  and every subgroup of `SL₂(𝓞_F)` containing a principal congruence kernel, the group
  cohomology with coefficients `⊗_σ Sym^{t_σ}(ℂ²)` has dimension at most a constant times
  `∏_σ (t_σ + 1) / min_σ (t_σ + 1)`;
* two-sided linear growth of `dim H^i(Γ, Sym^n(ℂ²) ⊗ conj Sym^n(ℂ²))`, `i = 1, 2`, for every
  congruence subgroup `Γ` of a Bianchi group.

Headline theorems of the README that are not statable at the pins:

* Fu's local homology theorem (README §2.6). It needs the classical Ore division ring of the
  rational Iwasawa algebra `ℚ_p ⊗ ℤ_p[[G]]` and the skew rank it defines, and rational completed
  Iwasawa homology `H_i(G, M ⊗ W_k)` with the diagonal action of `G`. Tau Ceti has the completed
  group algebra and the module structure on a topological module, but neither the Ore rank nor
  this homology.
* The sharp bound for cusp forms, `dim S_κ(K_f) ≤ C Δ(κ) / min_v κ_v` at an arbitrary compact
  open `K_f ⊂ SL₂(𝔸_F^∞)` (README §4.2), and its parallel-weight and Bianchi corollaries
  (§§4.3–4.4). The adelic space of cusp forms of archimedean weight `κ` does not exist at the pins.
* The cuspidal, interior and compact-support forms of the Bianchi two-sided bound (README §5.8).
  The Borel–Serre quotient, its compactly supported cohomology, the interior image and the
  cuspidal subspace do not exist at the pins.

Let `F` be a number field that is not totally real and `Γ ≤ SL₂(𝓞_F)` a subgroup containing the
principal congruence kernel of a nonzero ideal `𝔞`. There is a constant `C` such that for every
embedding weight `t`, every degree `i` and every integer `1 ≤ a ≤ min_σ (t_σ + 1)`, the group
cohomology `H^i(Γ, V_t)` is finite dimensional and `a · dim H^i(Γ, V_t) ≤ C ∏_σ (t_σ + 1)`. -/

/-- **Two-sided linear Bianchi growth** (README §5.8; fu24, Corollary 1.3; fgt10, Theorem 4.17
and Corollary 4.20). Let `F` be an imaginary quadratic field and `Γ ≤ SL₂(𝓞_F)` a subgroup
containing the principal congruence kernel of a nonzero ideal. Its two complex embeddings are
conjugate, so `V_{(n,n)} = Sym^n(ℂ²) ⊗ conj Sym^n(ℂ²)` is the coefficient system `E_n`. There are
`0 < c`, `C` and `n₀` such that for `n ≥ n₀` and `i ∈ {1, 2}` the group cohomology `H^i(Γ, E_n)`
is finite dimensional with `c (n + 1) ≤ dim H^i(Γ, E_n) ≤ C (n + 1)`. -/
