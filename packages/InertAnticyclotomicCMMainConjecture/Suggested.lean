# Inert anticyclotomic CM main conjecture: target signatures

The roadmap is README.md; this file is not the roadmap. It is meant to state the roadmap's
headline theorems against the pinned Mathlib and Tau Ceti. None of them is statable at the pins,
so the file states nothing; the headline theorems and what each one lacks are listed below.

* Layer 4 (§4.6): the inert anticyclotomic CM main conjecture (BKO21 Theorem 6.1, over the
  coefficient ring R⟦Γ⁻⟧ for a Gross Q-curve over the Hilbert class field). Its statement needs
  the signed Selmer groups of the CM avatar over the anticyclotomic ℤ_p-tower, the Lubin–Tate
  formal module with its signed formal points and character logarithms, the anticyclotomic
  local-unit module with its Coates–Wiles derivatives and the primitive elliptic-unit class
  (which define Rubin's p-adic L-function), and Gross Q-curves with their p-adic avatars. The
  pins have Hecke characters, continuous cohomology, the completed group algebra, the
  characteristic ideal `TauCeti.Iwasawa.charIdeal`, the general Selmer structure
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.SelmerStructure` with its Selmer group, and the `m`-Selmer group
  `WeierstrassCurve.selmerGroup` of an elliptic curve for every `m`. The signed Selmer groups
  would be Selmer groups of that structure, but their local conditions, the signed Kummer
  images of the Lubin–Tate formal module along the anticyclotomic tower, are not at the pins,
  and neither are the other carriers listed.
* Layer 4 (§4.2): torsion of the opposite signed Selmer dual and vanishing of the compact
  strict and opposite signed Selmer modules. It lacks the same signed Selmer carriers and the
  compact corestriction limits with their Cartier-dual local conditions.
* Layer 4 (§4.4): the opposite signed characteristic formula char(X_(−ε)) = char(H^ε/loc C).
  It lacks the signed Selmer carriers and the all-auxiliary elliptic-unit module; the
  characteristic ideal itself is the pinned `TauCeti.Iwasawa.charIdeal`.
* Layer 6 (§6.4): the finite-character CM rank bounds (BKO21 Theorem 6.2). It lacks Rubin's
  p-adic L-function, whose order of vanishing at χ is the bound, and the χ-isotypic parts with
  CM coefficients of the Mordell–Weil group and of the rational p-adic Selmer group of V_pE over
  the anticyclotomic layers; the pinned `p^k`-Selmer groups are the finite levels, not their
  limit with V_pE coefficients.

The pinned carriers do not by themselves provide these arithmetic objects, and no abstract
module, assumed pairing or proposition-valued stand-in replaces them here.
