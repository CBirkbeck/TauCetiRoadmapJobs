# Hilbert modular varieties and Shimura curves, part II: target signatures

The roadmap is README.md; this file is not the roadmap. It states the roadmap's
headline theorems that can be expressed against the pinned APIs, with only the
simple definitions needed to state them.

The following headline theorems are not statable at the pins:
* The quaternionic Gee–Kisin weight theorem needs the BDJ extension-class weight
  set and the quaternionic coefficient-cohomology multiplicity spaces.
* Functorial Shimura-curve patching and the big patched-module theorem need the
  global deformation datum, compatible tower coefficients and the patched module.
* Grade comparison with central variables, Cohen–Macaulay transfer and Iwasawa
  miracle flatness need the uniform analytic-group structure and its canonical
  dimension/depth interface on the native completed group algebra.
* Common-rank freeness for weights, tame types and projective lifts, and the
  locally algebraic support theorem, need the patching functor and tame K-types.
* Adjoint and glued-lattice freeness and first-order patched multiplicity need
  those functors, the projective-cover lattices and their Galois-type quotients.
* The weighted and unweighted Gelfand–Kirillov dimension theorems need the actual
  infinite-level quaternionic representation and its canonical dimension.
* The second-congruence structure theorem needs this representation and its
  first-order injective-envelope summands.
* Patched faithful flatness needs the actual big patched module and patched ring.
* Nonzero Banach lifts need these modules and the admissible unitary Banach
  category with integral Schikhof duality.
* Inert-prime big R = big T, faithful flatness of the completed-cohomology dual
  and the complete-intersection conclusion need the actual global deformation
  ring, completed Hecke image, quaternionic completed cohomology and its actions.

These constructions are targets of README.md, not additional axioms or ad hoc
encodings in this file. Numerical consequences are not substitutes for them.
